      How to Convert to XHTML
    </h1>
    <p>
      With nxhtml-mode you can edit XHTML documents, but not HTML
      dito. So what do you do with your old HTML documents? The
      answer is simple: You convert them to XHTML! There is today
      not many reasons not to convert them to XHTML. You may say
      "but what about old browsers?". Most users just do not have
      old browsers today. Old browsers are too dangerous to use on the
      Internet.

      You can convert the documents easily from within nxhtml-mode
      with <a href= "http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">Tidy</a>. However
      Tidy does not come with nxhtml, you have to install it yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Tidy is called from Emacs you can do a whole directory tree
      at once. When a buffer is in nxhtml-mode (and tidy.el is found)
      there is an entry on the menus called <b>Tidy</b> from which you
      can access tidy and set the options for it. Note especially the
      <b>Quick Options Settings</b> where you can set options for
      converting to XHTML easily.
