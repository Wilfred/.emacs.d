1.26 => 1.27 (2004-08-23)
=========================

 * Proposed and partially provided by Samuel Marshall <sam@leafdigital.com>
 * enhanced timezone handling, should be perfect now
 * new option -c, like -i but then asks interactively to let do it
 * if FTP user/password are set to ?, they are asked for interactively


1.25 => 1.26 (2004-03-31)
=========================

 * fixed "dangerous" algorithm of synchronization direction


1.24 => 1.25 (2004-03-20)
=========================

 * fixed some 1.24 bugs
 * clock offset computation now more resistant against very slow connections
 * clock offset computation disabled for GET mode, so mirroring of foreign
   stuff is now possible again
 * default localdir of . disabled, therefore
 * using . as localdir parameter does not cause a parsing error any more
 * replaced damn indentation tabs in sourcecode by appropriate number of 
   spaces, so code is readable independent of tab settings
 * enabled handling of ftpdir /
 * handling of relative ftpdir corrected


1.23 => 1.24 (2003-10-11)
=========================

 By Michiel Steltman <Msteltman@disway.nl>
 
 * handle files with blanks etc in names
 * clock offset remote-local to reduce unnecessary transfers
 * error handling
 

1.22 => 1.23 (2003-09-28)
=========================

 * New parameter timeout
   

1.21 => 1.22 (2003-03-24)
=========================

 * Now cuts of / at directory spec's end, to avoid pwd() being different 
   from target of cwd() (which lead to unneccesarry abortions)
   

1.20 => 1.21 (2003-03-24)
=========================

 * version information in sourcefile and output of -h command
 

1.11 => 1.20 (2003-03-22)
=========================

 * generally, most foreseeable problems are beeing checked, in particular:

   - unability to connect to FTP server
   - unability to login into FTP server
   - unability to change to local or remote base directory
   - unability to change to remote subdirectory
   - unability to create local or remote subdirectory
   - unability to remove local or remote subdirectory
   - unability to put or get a file within 3 trials
   
   All these errors (except the last one) leads to immediate abortion.


1.10 => 1.11 (2002-05-10)
=========================

 * Some optical corrections concerning output
 
 * Files are now automatically re-transferred until the size on both ends 
   matches

 * -? now corrrectly recognized 


1.00 => 1.10 (2001-10-28)
=========================

 * config file support
   This is mportant to avoid putting ftp passwords in the process list!

 * much more informative standard and verbose/debug output, including kind
   of a advance information
   
 * better FTP-URL parsing supporting such without user/password
 
 * much better default values, e.g. ftp://ftp:anonymous@localhost/., ...
 
 * softlinks are now detected (locally and remote) and treated somewhat
   correctly, i.e. they are ignored correctly ;-))



=> 1.00 (2001-10-26)
====================

* 1.0 created 2001-10-20 23:10 by Christoph Lechleitner <lech@ibcl.at>

Quite good for a 5 hour hack, isn't it?
O.K., I have already written similar programs for local file systems
in Pascal for DOS, Win3x and OS/2, and in VisualBasic for Win95b.
