Overview:
---------

ftpsync.pl synchronizes a local directory tree and a remote FTP directory tree.

It was initally written to automize web publishing, but might be useful for 
some other purposes, like mirroring not-too-large public sites, data
replication, and more.

Call "ftpsync.pl -h" to get a short parameter explanation.


Why use ftpsync.pl instead of mirror, sitecopy, ...?
----------------------------------------------------

Yes, there are similar projects, so some comments on them:

Compared to mirror, ftpsync.pl is capable of PUTing, not only GETing stuff
(Don't blame me if mirror is able to PUT, I could'nt find a way).

Compared to sitecopy, ftpsync.pl has no problems, if the remote site has been
changed since its last run by other tools and activites. Unless network
problems or bugs occur, ftpsync.pl does a reliable synchronization.

Compared to both, ftpsync.pl is very lightweight ;-))


Requirements / Restrictions:
----------------------------

- Perl 5.6+
  ftpsync.pl was initially developed on  Perl 5.6.0-81 on SuSE Linux 7.2,
  older Perl 5.x version might work. Test reports welcome at ftpsync@ibcl.at!

- File::Find, IO::Handle
  IMHO parts of the basic perl package.

- Net::FTP
  Part of the perl-libnet package.
  
- UNIX like operating systems on local system
  Porting to DOS based systems should be easily done by changing the 
  directory separator.
  
- Perhaps, the script does not work with all FTP servers
  It is beeing tested only against UNIX based FTP servers.


Bug-Reports, Contact:
---------------------

Besides ftpsync.sourceforge.net, ftpsync@ibcl.at is a good target for comments
of any kind.
