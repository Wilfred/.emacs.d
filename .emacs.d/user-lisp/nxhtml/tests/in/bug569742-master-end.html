From EmacsWiki:

I have chunk problems with 1.99. This works, it detects the PHP and JS chunks properly:

<?


$stuff = <<<EOTHTML

    <script type="text/javascript">

    //<![CDATA[

    var stuff;

    //]]>
    </script>

EOTHTML;


However if I donâ€™t close the inner chunk before EOTHTML, because I want to add some conditional code after it in PHP then it thinks the part of the buffer after EOTHTML is still in JS mode which is not good:

<?


$stuff = <<<EOTHTML

    <script type="text/javascript">

    //<![CDATA[

    var stuff;

EOTHTML;
