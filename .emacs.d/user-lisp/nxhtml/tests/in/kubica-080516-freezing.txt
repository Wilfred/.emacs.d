The problem seems to have to do with the { block pagestyle } thing
below. If that is removed then the freezing does not happen.

        <style type="text/css">
        	{ block pagestyle }
	p {
		margin: 0;

Try the files kubica-080516-freezing-i.html and dito j. The former
freezes Emacs, but the latter does not.
