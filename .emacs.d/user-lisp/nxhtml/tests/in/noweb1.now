\section{Hello world}

Today I awakened and decided to write
some code, so I started to write a Hello World in \textsf C.

<<hello.c>>=
/*
  <<license>>
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}
@
\noindent \ldots then I did the same in PHP.

<<hello.sql>>=
SELECT * FROM Persons
WHERE FirstName LIKE '%a'
@
<<hello.php>>=
<?php
  /*
  <<license>>
  */
  echo "Hello world!\n";
?>

Later, same day some lawyer reminded me about licenses.
So, here it is:

<<license>>=
This work is placed in the public domain.
