Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors. Its
historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as well.
Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper level
than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. It's possible to search for
related names and to list all names in a Python file and infer them. Jedi
understands docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as
well.

Jedi uses a very simple API to connect with IDE's. There's a reference
implementation as a `VIM-Plugin <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim>`_,
which uses Jedi's autocompletion.  We encourage you to use Jedi in your IDEs.
It's really easy.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors:

- Vim (jedi-vim_, YouCompleteMe_)
- Emacs (Jedi.el_, elpy_, anaconda-mode_, ycmd_)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI_ [ST2 + ST3], anaconda_ [only ST3])
- SynWrite_
- TextMate_ (Not sure if it's actually working)
- Kate_ version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it, though. [`proof
  <https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/applications/kate/repository/show?rev=KDE%2F4.13>`_]

And it powers the following projects:

- wdb_ - Web Debugger

Pydoc support (Shift+k).

There is also support for goto and renaming.

Get the latest version from `github <https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi>`_
(master branch should always be kind of stable/working).

Docs are available at `https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_. Pull requests with documentation
enhancements and/or fixes are awesome and most welcome. Jedi uses `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.


Installation
============

    pip install jedi

Note: This just installs the Jedi library, not the editor plugins. For
information about how to make it work with your editor, refer to the
corresponding documentation.

You don't want to use ``pip``? Please refer to the `manual
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html>`_.


Feature Support and Caveats
===========================

Jedi really understands your Python code. For a comprehensive list what Jedi
understands, see: `Features
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/features.html>`_. A list of
caveats can be found on the same page.

You can run Jedi on cPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 or 3.4, but it should also
understand/parse code older than those versions.

Tips on how to use Jedi efficiently can be found `here
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/recipes.html>`_.

API
---

You can find the documentation for the `API here <https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/plugin-api.html>`_.


Autocompletion / Goto / Pydoc
-----------------------------

Please check the API for a good explanation. There are the following commands:

- ``jedi.Script.goto_assignments``
- ``jedi.Script.completions``
- ``jedi.Script.usages``

The returned objects are very powerful and really all you might need.


Autocompletion in your REPL (IPython, etc.)
-------------------------------------------

It's possible to have Jedi autocompletion in REPL modes - `example video <https://vimeo.com/122332037>`_.
This means that IPython and others are `supported
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/usage.html#tab-completion-in-the-python-shell>`_.


Static Analysis / Linter
------------------------

To do all forms of static analysis, please try to use ``jedi.names``. It will
return a list of names that you can use to infer types and so on.

Linting is another thing that is going to be part of Jedi. For now you can try
an alpha version ``python -m jedi linter``. The API might change though and
it's still buggy. It's Jedi's goal to be smarter than classic linter and
understand ``AttributeError`` and other code issues.


Refactoring
-----------

Jedi would in theory support refactoring, but we have never publicized it,
because it's not production ready. If you're interested in helping out here,
let me know. With the latest parser changes, it should be very easy to actually
make it work.


Development
===========

There's a pretty good and extensive `development documentation
<https://jedi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/development.html>`_.


Testing
=======

The test suite depends on ``tox`` and ``pytest``::

    pip install tox pytest

To run the tests for all supported Python versions::

    tox

If you want to test only a specific Python version (e.g. Python 2.7), it's as
easy as ::

    tox -e py27

Tests are also run automatically on `Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/davidhalter/jedi/>`_.

.. :changelog:

Changelog
---------

0.9.0 (2015-04-10)
++++++++++++++++++

- Integrated the parser of 2to3. This will make refactoring possible. It will
  also be possible to check for error messages (like compiling an AST would give)
  in the future.
- With the new parser, the evaluation also completely changed. It's now simpler
  and more readable.
- Completely rewritten REPL completion.
- Added ``jedi.names``, a command to do static analysis. Thanks to that
  sourcegraph guys for sponsoring this!
- Alpha version of the linter.


0.8.1 (2014-07-23)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Bugfix release, the last release forgot to include files that improve
  autocompletion for builtin libraries. Fixed.

0.8.0 (2014-05-05)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Memory Consumption for compiled modules (e.g. builtins, sys) has been reduced
  drastically. Loading times are down as well (it takes basically as long as an
  import).
- REPL completion is starting to become usable.
- Various small API changes. Generally this release focuses on stability and
  refactoring of internal APIs.
- Introducing operator precedence, which makes calculating correct Array
  indices and ``__getattr__`` strings possible.

0.7.0 (2013-08-09)
++++++++++++++++++

- Switched from LGPL to MIT license.
- Added an Interpreter class to the API to make autocompletion in REPL
  possible.
- Added autocompletion support for namespace packages.
- Add sith.py, a new random testing method.

0.6.0 (2013-05-14)
++++++++++++++++++

- Much faster parser with builtin part caching.
- A test suite, thanks @tkf.

0.5 versions (2012)
+++++++++++++++++++

- Initial development.
