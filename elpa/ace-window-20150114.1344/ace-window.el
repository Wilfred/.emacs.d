;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package uses `ace-jump-mode' machinery to switch between
;; windows.
;;
;; The main function, `ace-window' is meant to replace `other-window'.
;; If fact, when there are only two windows present, `other-window' is
;; called.  If there are more, each window will have its first
;; character highlighted.  Pressing that character will switch to that
;; window.  Note that unlike `ace-jump-mode', the point position will
;; not be changed: only current window focus changes.
;;
;; To setup this package, just add to your ~.emacs:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "M-p") 'ace-window)
;;
;; replacing "M-p"  with an appropriate shortcut.
;;
;; Depending on your window usage patterns, you might want to set
;;
;;    (setq aw-keys '(?a ?s ?d ?f ?g ?h ?j ?k ?l))
;;
;; This way they're all on the home row, although the intuitive
;; ordering is lost.
;;
;; When prefixed with one `universal-argument', instead of switching
;; to selected window, the selected window is swapped with current one.
;;
;; When prefixed with two `universal-argument', the selected window is
;; deleted instead.
