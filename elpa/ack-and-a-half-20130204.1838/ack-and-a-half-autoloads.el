PATTERN is interpreted as a regular expression, iff REGEXP is
non-nil.  If called interactively, the value of REGEXP is
determined by `ack-and-a-half-regexp-search'.  A prefix arg
toggles the behavior.  DIRECTORY is the root directory.  If
called interactively, it is determined by
`ack-and-a-half-project-root-file-patterns'.  The user is only
prompted, if `ack-and-a-half-prompt-for-directory' is set.
