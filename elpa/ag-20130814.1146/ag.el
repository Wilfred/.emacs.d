;; X-Original-Version: 0.26

;;; Commentary:

;; This file is heavily based on the excellent ack-and-a-half.el.

;; Usage:

;; Add you to your .emacs.d:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ag.el") ;; optional
;; (require 'ag)

;; Alternatively, just install the package from MELPA.

;; If you're using ag 0.14+, which supports --color-match, then you
;; can add highlighting with:

;; (setq ag-highlight-search t)

;; I like to bind the *-at-point commands to F5 and F6:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'ag-project)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'ag-regexp-project-at-point)
