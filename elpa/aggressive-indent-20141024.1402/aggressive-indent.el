;;; aggressive-indent.el --- Minor mode to aggressively keep your code always indented

;; Copyright (C) 2014 Artur Malabarba <bruce.connor.am@gmail.com>

;; Author: Artur Malabarba <bruce.connor.am@gmail.com>
;; URL: http://github.com/Bruce-Connor/aggressive-indent-mode
;; Version: 20141024.1402
;; X-Original-Version: 0.3
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.1") (names "0.5") (cl-lib "0.5"))
;; Keywords: indent lisp maint tools
;; Prefix: aggressive-indent
;; Separator: -

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `electric-indent-mode' is enough to keep your code nicely aligned when
;; all you do is type. However, once you start shifting blocks around,
;; transposing lines, or slurping and barfing sexps, indentation is bound
;; to go wrong.
;;
;; `aggressive-indent-mode' is a minor mode that keeps your code always
;; indented. It reindents after every command, making it more reliable
;; than `electric-indent-mode'.
;;
;; ### Instructions ###
;;
;; This package is available fom Melpa, you may install it by calling
;;
;;     M-x package-install RET aggressive-indent
;;
;; Then activate it with
;;
;;     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'aggressive-indent-mode)
;;     (add-hook 'css-mode-hook #'aggressive-indent-mode)
;;
;; You can use this hook on any mode you want, `aggressive-indent' is not
;; exclusive to emacs-lisp code. In fact, if you want to turn it on for
;; every programming mode, you can do something like:
;;
;;     (global-aggressive-indent-mode 1)
;;     (add-to-list 'aggressive-indent-excluded-modes 'html-mode)
;;
;; ### Manual Installation ###
;;
;; If you don't want to install from Melpa, you can download it manually,
;; place it in your `load-path' and require it with
;;
;;     (require 'aggressive-indent)

;;; Change Log:
;; 0.3 - 2014/10/23 - Implement a smarter engine for non-lisp modes.
;; 0.2 - 2014/10/20 - Reactivate `electric-indent-mode'.
;; 0.2 - 2014/10/19 - Add variable `aggressive-indent-dont-indent-if', so the user can prevent indentation.
;; 0.1 - 2014/10/15 - Release.
