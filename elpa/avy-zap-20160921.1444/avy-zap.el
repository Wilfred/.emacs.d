;; Zap to char using [avy].

;; Note: The behaviors of the *dwim* function when called with prefix and
;; without prefix are inverted now! By default(i.e. when the *dwim*
;; function is called without prefix), the avy version will be used now!
;; For those who want the old behavior, set the following variable to
;; `nil':
;; ,----
;; | (setq avy-zap-dwim-prefer-avy nil)
;; `----

;; This package is basically a fork of the functionality of [ace-jump-zap],
;; but using [avy] instead of [ace-jump-mode] as the jumping method.

;; 1 Setup
;; =======

;;   ,----
;;   | (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/avy-zap.el")
;;   | (require 'avy-zap)
;;   `----

;;   Recommendation: install `avy-zap' via [melpa].


;; [melpa] http://melpa.org


;; 2 Usage
;; =======

;;   Use `avy-zap-to-char' or `avy-zap-up-to-char' to perform `zap-to-char'
;;   or `zap-up-to-char' in "avy-style"!

;;   There are two *Do-What-I-Mean* versions: `avy-zap-to-char-dwim' and
;;   `avy-zap-up-to-char-dwim'. `avy-zap-(up-)to-char-dwim' will perform
;;   `zap-(up-)to-char' with prefix. If calling *dwim* versions without
;;   prefix, then `avy-zap-(up-)to-char' will be used instead. The plain
;;   `zap-(up-)to-char' will also be used when you are defining or
;;   executing a macro.

;;   You can give key bindings to these commands. For example:
;;   ,----
;;   | (global-set-key (kbd "M-z") 'avy-zap-to-char-dwim)
;;   | (global-set-key (kbd "M-Z") 'avy-zap-up-to-char-dwim)
;;   `----


;; 3 Customization
;; ===============

;;   - `avy-zap-forward-only': Setting this variable to non-nil means
;;     zapping from the current point. The default value is `nil'.
;;   - `avy-zap-function': Choose between `kill-region' and
;;     `delete-region'. The default value is `kill-region'.
;;   - `avy-zap-dwim-prefer-avy': Whether the default dwim behavior(when
;;     called without prefix) of `avy-zap' should use `avy' or not. The
;;     default value is `t'. You can set this variable to `nil' if you
;;     prefer using plain zap when calling the dwim commands without
;;     prefix.


;; 4 Compared to ace-jump-zap
;; ==========================

;;   This package provides the same functionality as `ace-jump-zap', but
;;   lacks the `ajz/sort-by-closest' and `ajz/52-character-limit'
;;   customization options. I don't use the sorting feature of
;;   `ace-jump-zap', but if someone finds it useful, welcome to submit a
;;   pull request!
