;;; Commentary:

;; Ever wish to go back to an older saved version of a file?  Then
;; this package is for you.  This package copies every file you save
;; in emacs to a backup directory tree (which mirrors the tree
;; structure of the filesystem), with a timestamp suffix to make
;; multiple saves of the same file unique.  Never lose old saved
;; versions again.

;; To activate globally, place this file in your `load-path', and add
;; the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;; (require 'backup-each-save)
;; (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'backup-each-save)

;; To activate only for individual files, add the require line as
;; above to your ~/.emacs, and place a local variables entry at the
;; end of your file containing the statement:
;;
;; eval: (add-hook (make-local-variable 'after-save-hook) 'backup-each-save)
;;
;; NOTE:  I would give a full example of how to do this here, but it
;; would then try to activate it for this file since it is a short
;; file and the docs would then be within the "end of the file" local
;; variables region. :)

;; To filter out which files it backs up, use a custom function for
;; `backup-each-save-filter-function'.  For example, to filter out
;; the saving of gnus .newsrc.eld files, do:
;;
;; (defun backup-each-save-no-newsrc-eld (filename)
;;   (cond
;;    ((string= (file-name-nondirectory filename) ".newsrc.eld") nil)
;;    (t t)))
;; (setq backup-each-save-filter-function 'backup-each-save-no-newsrc-eld)

;;; Notes:
;; Tested on GNU Emacs 21.3.X and XEmacs (21.4.15 no mule).
;; Features/bug reports/enhancements welcome. -- Benjamin Rutt

;;; ChangeLog
;; v1.0 -> v1.1:  added backup-each-save-filter-function
;; v1.1 -> v1.2:  i)  added backup-each-save-size-limit
;;                ii) fixed "Local Variables" docs, which was inadvertently
;;                    being activated
;; v1.2 -> v1.3:  fix for some emacsen not having `file-remote-p'
