;; This file is NOT a part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; To enable: put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'c-turn-on-eldoc-mode)

;; Chinmay Kamat -- made changes to the regular expression to make sure that function calls in macros do not
;; override actual function definitions while searching
;; v0.6 20/05/2010

;; Nathaniel has submitted a caching patch to make this workable on large projects "like the emacs
;; codebase"
;; v0.5 01/02/2010

;; Provides helpful description of the arguments to C functions.
;; Uses child process grep and preprocessor commands for speed.
;; v0.4 01/16/2005

elements expire at some condition, as specified by init-fun and
test-fun.  The three arguments do as follows:

init-fun is a function that is called when a new item is inserted
into the cache.

test-fun is a function that is called when an item in the cache
is looked up.  It takes one argument, and will be passed the
result of init-fun that was generated when the item was inserted
into the cache.

cleanup-fun is called when an item is removed from the hash
table.  It takes one argument, the value of the key-value pair
being deleted.

Note that values are only deleted from the cache when accessed.

This will return a list of 4 elements: a has table and the 3
arguments.  All hash-table functions will work on the car of this
list, although if accessed directly the lookups will return a pair
(value, (init-fun)).

The keyword arguments are the same as for make-hash-table and are applied
to the created hash table."
