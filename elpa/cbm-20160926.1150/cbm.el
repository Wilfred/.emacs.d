;;; Commentary:

;; Installation:

;; Put cbm.el in your `load-path' and require it:
;;
;; (require 'cbm)

;; It is recommended to bind `cbm-cycle', `cbm-switch-buffer' and
;; `cbm-find-org-agenda-file' to a key:
;;
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-;") #'cbm-cycle)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-'") #'cbm-switch-buffer)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") #'cbm-find-org-agenda-file)
;; (define-key rcirc-mode-map (kbd "M-i") #'cbm-rcirc-switch-to-channel)

;; Usage:

;; This package provides useful commands for switching to similar
;; buffers. It's particularly handy for switching between buffers in
;; the same major mode.
