;;; Commentary:

;; # change-inner.el
;;
;; change-inner gives you vim's `ci` command, building on
;; [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el). It is most easily
;; explained by example:
;;
;;     function test() {
;;       return "semantic kill";
;;     }
;;
;; With point after the word `semantic`
;;
;;  * `change-inner "` would kill the contents of the string
;;  * `change-outer "` would kill the entire string
;;  * `change-inner {` would kill the return-statement
;;  * `change-outer {` would kill the entire block
;;
;; I use `M-i` and `M-o` for this.
;;
;; Giving these commands a prefix argument `C-u` means copy instead of kill.
;;
;; ## Installation
;;
;; Start by installing
;; [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el).
;;
;;     (require 'change-inner)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-i") 'change-inner)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "M-o") 'change-outer)
;;
;; ## It's not working in my favorite mode
;;
;; That may just be because expand-region needs some love for your mode. Please
;; open a ticket there: https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el
