  "Function that returns candidate annotations.

This function takes a single argument, a completion candidate
produced by anaconda-mode.  It should return an annotation string
to be displayed by company-mode as the annotation for this
candidate, or nil if no annotation should be displayed.

The candidate is a string, a possible completion.  The candidate
may also have some text properties containing additional
information.  These properties are:

- description: Jedi's description, typically the type of
  completion optionally followed by a fully-qualified name for
  the candidate.  For example, \"class: foo.bar.Baz\" or
  \"statement\".

- module-path: The path to the file that contains this candidate.

- line: The line within that file where the candidate is defined.

- docstring: The candidate's docstring.

You can retrieve any of these properties with
`get-text-property', such as
\(get-text-property 0 'description candidate).  Bear in mind that
any of these properties may be absent for any candidate."
