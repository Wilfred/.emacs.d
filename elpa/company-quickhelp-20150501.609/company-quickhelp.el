;;; Commentary:

;; When idling on a completion candidate the documentation for the
;; candidate will pop up after `company-quickhelp-idle-delay' seconds.

;;; Usage:
;;  put (company-quickhelp-mode 1) in you init.el to activate
;;  `company-quickhelp-mode'.

;; You can adjust the time it takes for the documentation to pop up by
;; changing `company-quickhelp-delay'
