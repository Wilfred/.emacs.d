Non-nil if Company-Statistics mode is enabled.
See the `company-statistics-mode' command
for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `company-statistics-mode'.")

Statistical sorting for company-mode.  Ranks completion candidates by
the frequency with which they have been chosen in recent (as given by
`company-statistics-size') history.

Turning this mode on and off preserves the statistics.  They are also
preserved automatically between Emacs sessions in the default
configuration.  You can customize this behavior with
`company-statistics-auto-save', `company-statistics-auto-restore' and
`company-statistics-file'.
