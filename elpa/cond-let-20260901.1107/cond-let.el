;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs provides the binding conditionals `if-let', `if-let*',
;; `when-let', `when-let*', `and-let*' and `while-let'.

;; This package implements the missing `and-let' and `while-let*';
;; and the original `cond-let', `cond-let*', `when$', `and$' and
;; `thread$'.

;; This package additionally provides more consistent and improved
;; implementations of the binding conditionals already provided by
;; Emacs.  Merely loading this library does not shadow the built-in
;; implementations; this can optionally be done in the context of
;; an individual library, as described below.

;; `cond-let' and `cond-let*' are provided exactly under these names.
;; The names of all other macros implemented by this package begin
;; with `cond-let--', the package's prefix for private symbol.

;; Users of this package are not expected to use these unwieldy
;; names.  Instead one should use Emacs' shorthand feature to use
;; all or some of these macros by their conceptual names.  E.g., if
;; you want to use all of the available macros, add this at the end
;; of a library.

;; Local Variables:
;; read-symbol-shorthands: (
;;   ("and$"       . "cond-let--and$")
;;   ("thread$"    . "cond-let--thread$")
;;   ("when$"      . "cond-let--when$")
;;   ("and-let*"   . "cond-let--and-let*")
;;   ("and-let"    . "cond-let--and-let")
;;   ("if-let*"    . "cond-let--if-let*")
;;   ("if-let"     . "cond-let--if-let")
;;   ("when-let*"  . "cond-let--when-let*")
;;   ("when-let"   . "cond-let--when-let")
;;   ("while-let*" . "cond-let--while-let*")
;;   ("while-let"  . "cond-let--while-let"))
;; End:

;; You can think of these file-local settings as import statements of
;; sorts.  If you do this, then this package's implementations shadow
;; the built-in implementations.  Doing so does not affect any other
;; libraries, which continue to use the built-in implementations.

;; Due to limitations of the shorthand implementation this has to be
;; done for each individual library.  ".dir-locals.el" cannot be used.

;; If you use `when$', `and$' and `thread$', you might want to add
;; this to your configuration:

;;   (with-eval-after-load 'cond-let
;;     (font-lock-add-keywords 'emacs-lisp-mode
;;                             cond-let-font-lock-keywords t))

;; For information about the individual macros, please refer to their
;; docstrings.

  "Instead of this alias, use `cond-let--and$' via `and$' shorthand.

This alias will likely be declared obsolete in 2027.  If you would like
to continue to use it, please get in contact before then.  This alias
might eventually be removed altogether; again subject to user feedback.

If you do not care about the symbol `cond-let--and>', but want to keep
using the respective `and>' shorthand, you can future-proof that now,
by changing the shorthand definition to (\"and>\" . \"cond-let--and$\").")
