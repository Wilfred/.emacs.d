;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs Lisp Mock is a library for mocking and stubbing using
;; readable syntax. Most commonly Emacs Lisp Mock is used in
;; conjunction with Emacs Lisp Expectations, but it can be used in
;; other contexts.

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;; Emacs Lisp Mock provides two scope interface of mock and stub:
;; `with-mock' and `mocklet'. `with-mock' only defines a
;; scope. `mocklet' is more sophisticated interface than `with-mock':
;; `mocklet' defines local mock and stub like `let', `flet', and
;; `macrolet'.

;; Within `with-mock' body (or argument function specified in
;; `mock-protect'), you can create a mock and a stub. To create a
;; stub, use `stub' macro. To create a mock, use `mock' macro.
  
;; For further information: see docstrings.

;;; Bug Report:
;;
;; If you have problem, send a bug report via M-x mock-send-bug-report.
;; The step is:
;;  0) Setup mail in Emacs, the easiest way is:
;;       (setq user-mail-address "your@mail.address")
;;       (setq user-full-name "Your Full Name")
;;       (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "your.smtp.server.jp")
;;       (setq mail-user-agent 'message-user-agent)
;;       (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)
;;  1) Be sure to use the LATEST version of el-mock.el.
;;  2) Enable debugger. M-x toggle-debug-on-error or (setq debug-on-error t)
;;  3) Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: (load "el-mock.el")
;;  4) Do it!
;;  5) If you got an error, please do not close *Backtrace* buffer.
;;  6) M-x mock-send-bug-report and M-x insert-buffer *Backtrace*
;;  7) Describe the bug using a precise recipe.
;;  8) Type C-c C-c to send.
