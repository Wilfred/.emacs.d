;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs Lisp Mock is a library for mocking and stubbing using
;; readable syntax. Most commonly Emacs Lisp Mock is used in
;; conjunction with Emacs Lisp Expectations, but it can be used in
;; other contexts.

;;; Commands:

;; Emacs Lisp Mock provides two scope interface of mock and stub:
;; `with-mock' and `mocklet'. `with-mock' only defines a
;; scope. `mocklet' is more sophisticated interface than `with-mock':
;; `mocklet' defines local mock and stub like `let', `flet', and
;; `macrolet'.

;; Within `with-mock' body (or argument function specified in
;; `mock-protect'), you can create a mock and a stub. To create a
;; stub, use `stub' macro. To create a mock, use `mock' macro.
  
;; For further information: see docstrings.
