Excorporate Manual
******************

Excorporate provides Exchange Web Services (EWS) support for Emacs.

   If the Exchange server you access is configured to provide EWS
support, then there's a 76% chance that Excorporate will enable you to
retrieve your calendar entries from the comfort of Emacs.

   The 24% failure rate is because accessing - in particular,
authenticating against - an Exchange server can be challenging.

   Known to fail are Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication and accessing the
server through a proxy
(<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10>).

   Patches are welcome to enable more of these access scenarios.

1 Installation
**************

Excorporate works on Emacs versions >= 24.1.

Install 'excorporate' from the GNU ELPA repository:

   'M-x package-install RET excorporate'

2 Configuration
***************

Ideally you won't need to configure Excorporate at all.  On friendly
Exchange setups, Excorporate can discover the EWS URL automatically.

First try:

   'M-x excorporate'

which will prompt you for the Exchange account email address.  Follow
the prompts and if all goes well, you'll see a message in the minibuffer
or in *Messages* saying that the connection is ready.

If autodiscovery runs out of URLs to try, then customize
'excorporate-configuration':

   'M-x customize-variable RET excorporate-configuration'

From the value menu select "Skip autodiscovery".  This allows you to
enter the Exchange account email address and the EWS URL directly.  The
EWS URL is of the form 'https://mail.gnu.org/ews/exchange.asmx'.

After saving the configuration, try 'M-x excorporate' again.

If that doesn't work, then you're probably out of luck, or you'll have
to start a troubleshooting deep dive (*note Troubleshooting::).

3 Usage
*******

Excorporate binds 'e' in '*Calendar*' buffers.  Open the calendar with:

   'M-x calendar'

move the cursor to the date you want to see meetings for, and press 'e'.
This will show the meetings in a temporary read-only Org Mode buffer
named '*Excorporate*'.

4 Troubleshooting
*****************

First, you'll want to double-check that the Exchange server you're
trying to access provides EWS support.  If it doesn't, Excorporate can't
do anything for you.  Before asking your Exchange administrator, check
intranet wikis and so forth; other users of non-standard clients may
have already found the EWS URL. This is called the "EWS endpoint".  I
can be as simple as something like:

   'https://mail.gnu.org/ews/exchange.asmx'

First you need to make sure you can access the endpoint.

For Exchange Web Services (EWS) which Excorporate uses, you'll have to
determine the EWS endpoint for your Exchange account, call it 'ews-url'.
It is usually something like:

   https://<mail host name>/ews/exchange.asmx

Excorporate calculates the WSDL URL, call it 'wsdl-url', by replacing
the endpoint's last path element with "Services.wsdl":

   https://<mail host name>/ews/Services.wsdl

Before even attempting Excorporate, you have to make these succeed:

     (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously ews-url)
      (buffer-string))

When this works, you'll see web page text in *Messages*, containing a
message about having created a service.

     (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously wsdl-url)
      (buffer-string))

When this works, it will show a bunch of WSDL (XML) in *Messages*.

Debug the above URL retrievals with (setq url-debug t), and with this
patch:

     diff --git a/lisp/url/url-http.el b/lisp/url/url-http.el
     index d49e527..0f1c8ae 100644
     --- a/lisp/url/url-http.el
     +++ b/lisp/url/url-http.el
     @ -869,6 +869,7 @ url-http-parse-headers
            (url-handle-content-transfer-encoding))
          (url-http-debug "Finished parsing HTTP headers: %S" success)
          (widen)
     +    (url-http-debug "Response: %s" (buffer-string))
          (goto-char (point-min))
          success))


(Beware that HTTP responses are out-of-order with this patch.)

Once you're sure the above steps are working, try 'M-x excorporate'.

The buffer '*fsm-debug*' shows 'excorporate' state transitions and
should provide details of where things went wrong.

Also check '*Messages*' for anything obvious.

If you suspect something wrong with accessing the EWS URL, try setting
'url-debug' to t and retry 'M-x excorporate', then check the
'*URL-DEBUG*' buffer for output.

If you suspect NTLM authentication is failing, as a long shot, you might
try setting 'ntlm-compatibility-level' to 0 and retrying 'M-x
excorporate'.

Excorporate's dependencies implement the tricky elements of asynchronous
Exchange access: a state machine ('fsm'), TLS negotiation ('gnutls'),
NTLM authentication ('ntlm' and 'url-http-ntlm') and SOAP communication
('soap-client').
