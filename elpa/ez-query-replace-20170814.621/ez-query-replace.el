;;; ez-query-replace.el --- a smarter context-sensitive query-replace that can be reapplied

;;; Commentary:

;; ez-query-replace is a simple wrapper around `query-replace' that adds a
;; default search term, and allows you to conveniently replay old
;; replacements.

;;; Usage:

;; The ez-query-replace commands are autoloaded, so you don't need to
;; (require 'ez-query-replace). Just install ez-query-replace and bind
;; it to your desired keys. I prefer to override the default
;; query-replace bindings:

;; (define-key global-map (kbd "M-%") 'ez-query-replace)
;; (define-key global-map (kbd "C-c M-%") 'ez-query-replace-repeat)
