(defmacro* flet-overrides (predicate

  "Override functions only when an argument tests true.

PREDICATE is some test to be applied to a specified argument
of each bound FUNC to decide whether to execute the overridden
code or the existing code.

For each function, TEST-ARG specifies the name of the argument in
the ARGLIST which will be passed to the PREDICATE.

BODY defines the code to be run for the specified FUNC when the
PREDICATE is `t' for the TEST-ARG.

This is really useful when you want to mock a set of functions
that operate on a particular type, processes for example:

  (flet-overrides fake-process-p
     ((process-buffer process (process)
        (get-buffer-create \"\"))
      (process-status process (process)
        \"run\")
      (delete-process process (process)
        t)
      (set-process-buffer process (process buffer)
        nil))
    ;; Code under test
    ...)

 (process-get :fake :elnode-http-method)

`process-put' is also remapped, to set any setting.

`process-buffer' is also remapped, to deliver the value of the
key `:buffer' if present and a dummy buffer otherwise.

`delete-process' is also remapped, to throw
`:mock-process-finished' to the catch called
`:mock-process-finished'.  You can implement your own catch to do
something with the `delete-process' event.

`process-send-string' is also remapped to send to a fake output
buffer.  The fake buffer can be returned with
`fakir-get-output-buffer'.

In normal circumstances, we return what the BODY returned."
