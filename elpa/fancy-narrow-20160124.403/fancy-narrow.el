;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; fancy-narrow
;; ============
;; 
;; Emacs package to immitate `narrow-to-region' with more eye-candy.
;; 
;; Unlike `narrow-to-region', which completely hides text outside
;; the narrowed region, this package simply deemphasizes the text,
;; makes it readonly, and makes it unreachable.
;; 
;; This leads to a much more natural feeling, where the region stays
;; static (instead of being brutally moved to a blank slate) and is
;; clearly highlighted with respect to the rest of the buffer.
;; 
;; Simply call `fancy-narrow-to-region' to see it in action. To widen the
;; region again afterwards use `fancy-widen'.
;; 
;; To customise the face used to deemphasize unreachable text, customise
;; `fancy-narrow-blocked-face'. 
;; 
;; Note this is designed for user interaction. For using within lisp code,
;; the standard `narrow-to-region' is preferable, because the fancy
;; version is susceptible to `inhibit-read-only' and some corner cases.
