Minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.

When called interactively, toggle `flycheck-mode'.  With prefix
ARG, enable `flycheck-mode' if ARG is positive, otherwise disable
it.

When called from Lisp, enable `flycheck-mode' if ARG is omitted,
nil or positive.  If ARG is `toggle', toggle `flycheck-mode'.
Otherwise behave as if called interactively.

In `flycheck-mode' the buffer is automatically syntax-checked
using the first suitable syntax checker from `flycheck-checkers'.
Use `flycheck-select-checker' to select a checker for the current
buffer manually.

(autoload 'flycheck-declare-checker "flycheck" "\
Declare SYMBOL as syntax checker with DOCSTRING and PROPERTIES.

DOCSTRING provides documentation for the new checker.  Use
`flycheck-checker-documentation' to access the documentation
string of a checker, and `flycheck-describe-checker' to get help
about a checker.

The following PROPERTIES are understood:

`:command' A list with the executable (in `car') and the
arguments (in `cdr') of the syntax checker.  The executable is
checked for existence with `executable-find' before executing the
checker.  The arguments are substituted with
`flycheck-substitute-argument' before execution, see the
documentation of this function for a list of special tags allowed
in arguments.

`:error-patterns' A list of error patterns to parse the output of
the checker.  Each pattern is a list (REGEXP LEVEL).  REGEXP is a
regular expression that matches an error.  This regular
expression may contain match groups extracting specific
information about the error.  The 1st group is the file name, the
2nd group the line number, the 3rd group the column number and
the 4th group the error message.  A group is ignored if it did
not match or the match returned an empty string.  LEVEL is either
warning or error and determines the severity of the error message
parsed with the pattern.

`:error-parser' A function symbol to parse errors with.  The
function must accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER BUFFER, where
OUTPUT is the output as string and CHECKER the checker symbol
that was used to check BUFFER.  The function must return a list
of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from OUTPUT.

`:modes' A major mode symbol or a list thereof.  If present the
checker is only used in these modes.

`:predicate' An Emacs Lisp form.  If present the syntax checker
is only used if this form returns a non-nil result when evaluated
in the buffer to check.  The form is wrapped into a `lambda'
function to support byte compilation.

`:next-checkers' A list where each element is either a checker
symbol to run after this checker or a cons cell (PREDICATE
. CHECKER).  In the latter case, CHECKER is the checker symbol to
run, and the PREDICATE symbol specifies when to run the checker:
If PREDICATE is `no-errors' run the next checker only if this
checker returned no errors at all.  If PREDICATE is
`warnings-only', run the next checker only if this checker
returned only warnings.  Only the first usable and
registered (see `flycheck-registered-checker-p') is run.

A checker must have a `:command' property, either
`:error-patterns' or `:error-parser' (but not both), and at least
one of `:predicate' and `:modes'.  If `:predicate' and `:modes'
are present, both must match for the checker to be used.

SYMBOL is declared as customizable variable (see `defcustom`)
