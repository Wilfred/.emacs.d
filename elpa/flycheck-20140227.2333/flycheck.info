File: flycheck.info,  Node: Installation,  Prev: 3rd party extensions,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Installation
================

Flycheck supports Emacs 24.  It is tested with Emacs 24.3, and Emacs
snapshot builds.  It should work with GNU Emacs 24.1 and 24.2 as well,
but it is not tested against these versions.  If it does not work with
these versions, please report an issue.

     Note: For almost all supported languages, Flycheck also needs
     additional *external* checker programs.  See *note Supported
     languages: 7. for a list of supported languages and the
     corresponding checkers programs, and use *note
     flycheck-describe-checker: 10. to get help about specific checkers
     inside Emacs.

     For instance, for Python you need either Flake8(1) or Pylint(2),
     which can be installed with `pip install flake8' and `pip install
     pylint' respectively.

     Generally you can install the required external checker programs
     with the standard package manager of the corresponding programming
     languages (e.g. Rubygems for Ruby, NPM for Javascript).  Many
     checker programs are also available in the package repositories of
     popular Linux distributions, or as Formula for the OS X package
     manager Homebrew(3).

     Warning: Flycheck does not support Windows, but tries to be
     compatible with it.  You may try to use Flycheck on Windows.  It
     should mostly work, but expect problems and issues.  Pull requests
     which improve Windows compatibility are welcome.

     Flycheck also does not support GNU Emacs 23 and other flavors of
     Emacs (e.g. XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.).  Don't try, it will _not_
     work.

Install the ELPA package from MELPA(4) or Marmalade(5) using `M-x
package-install RET flycheck'.  The former is the _recommended_
repository.

Neither of these repositories is included in GNU Emacs by default.  You
need to enable these repositories explicitly.  For instance, to add the
MELPA repository, add the following code to `init.el':

    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)
    (package-initialize)

If you use Cask(6), add the following to your `Cask' file:

    (source gnu)
    (source melpa)

    (depends-on "flycheck")

2 Usage
*******

* Menu:

* Flycheck Mode::
* Syntax checking::
* Syntax checker selection::
* Syntax checker configuration::
* Error reporting::
* Error navigation::
* Mode line::


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Flycheck Mode,  Next: Syntax checking,  Up: Usage

2.1 Flycheck Mode
=================

Syntax checking is done in the Flycheck minor mode:

 -- Command: M-x flycheck-mode
     Toggle Flycheck Mode for the current buffer.

 -- User Option: flycheck-mode
     Whether Flycheck Mode is enabled in the current buffer.

 -- Command: M-x global-flycheck-mode
     Toggle Flycheck Mode for *all* live buffers, and for new buffers.

     With Global Flycheck Mode, Flycheck Mode is automatically enabled
     in all buffers, for which a *note suitable syntax checker: 19.
     exists and is enabled.

          Note: Flycheck Mode will *not* be enabled in buffers for
          remote or encrypted files.  The former is flaky and might be
          very slow, and the latter might leak confidential data to
          temporary directories.

          You can still explicitly enable Flycheck Mode in such buffers
          with *note flycheck-mode: 16.  This is *not* recommended
          though.

 -- User Option: global-flycheck-mode
     Whether Flycheck Mode is enabled globally.

If you like Flycheck Mode, you may want to enable it permanently,
either by customizing *note global-flycheck-mode: 1a, or by adding the
following code to your `init.el':

    (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checking,  Next: Syntax checker selection,  Prev: Flycheck Mode,  Up: Usage

2.2 Syntax checking
===================

By default, *note Flycheck Mode: 14. checks syntax automatically when

   - the mode is enabled,

   - the file is saved,

   - new lines are inserted,

   - or some short time after the last change to the buffer.

However, you can customize automatic syntax checking with *note
flycheck-check-syntax-automatically: 1c.:

 -- User Option: flycheck-check-syntax-automatically
     When Flycheck should check syntax automatically.

     This variable is list of events that may trigger syntax checks.
     The following events are known:

    `mode-enabled'
          Check syntax immediately when *note flycheck-mode: 16. is
          enabled.

    `save'
          Check syntax immediately after the buffer was saved.

    `new-line'
          Check syntax immediately after a new line was inserted into
          the buffer.

    `idle-change'
          Check syntax a short time (see *note
          flycheck-idle-change-delay: 1d.) after the last change to the
          buffer.

     An syntax check is only conducted for events that are contained in
     this list.  For instance, the following setting will cause
     Flycheck to _only_ check if the mode is enabled or the buffer was
     saved, but _never_ after changes to the buffer contents:

         (setq flycheck-check-syntax-automatically '(mode-enabled save))

     If the list is empty syntax is never checked automatically.  In
     this case, use *note flycheck-buffer: 1e. to check syntax manually.

 -- User Option: flycheck-idle-change-delay
     How many seconds to wait before starting a syntax check.

     After the buffer was changed, Flycheck waits as many seconds as
     the value of this variable before starting a syntax check.  If the
     buffer is changed during this time, Flycheck starts to wait again.

     This variable has no effect, if `idle-change' is not contained in
     *note flycheck-check-syntax-automatically: 1c.

Regardless of automatic syntax checking you can also check the buffer
manually:

 -- Command: C-c ! c
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-buffer
     Start a syntax check in the current buffer.

Each syntax check conducts the following steps:

  1. Run hooks in *note flycheck-before-syntax-check-hook: 1f.

  2. Clear error information from previous syntax checks.

  3. Select a *note suitable syntax checker: 19.  See *note Syntax
     checker selection: 20, for more information on how syntax checkers
     are selected.

  4. Copy the contents of the buffer to be checked to a temporary file.

  5. Run the syntax checker.

  6. Parse the output of the tool, and report all errors and warnings.
     See *note Error reporting: 9, for more information.

  7. If the buffer can be checked with another syntax checker, continue
     from step 4, but with the next syntax checker.  This is called
     “chaining” of syntax checkers.

  8. Run hooks in *note flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook: 21.

 -- Hook: flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook
     Functions to run after each syntax check.

     This hook is run after a syntax check was finished.

     At this point, *all* chained checkers were run, and all errors
     were parsed, highlighted and reported.  See *note Error reporting:
     9, for more information about error reporting.  The variable *note
     flycheck-current-errors: 22.  contains all errors from all syntax
     checkers run during the syntax check, so you can use the various
     error analysis functions.

     Note that this hook does *not* run after each individual syntax
     checker in the syntax checker chain, but only after the *last
     checker*.

     This variable is a normal hook. See *note Hooks: (elisp)Hooks.

 -- Hook: flycheck-before-syntax-check-hook
     Functions to run before each syntax check.

     This hook is run right before a syntax check starts.

     Error information from the previous syntax check is *not* cleared
     before this hook runs.

     Note that this hook does *not* run before each individual syntax
     checker in the syntax checker chain, but only before the *first
     checker*.

     This variable is a normal hook. See *note Hooks: (elisp)Hooks.

There is also a hook run whenever a syntax check fails:

 -- Hook: flycheck-syntax-check-failed-hook
     Functions to run if a syntax check failed.

     This hook is run whenever an error occurs during Flycheck's
     internal processing.  No information about the error is given to
     this hook.

     You should use this hook to conduct additional cleanup actions
     when Flycheck failed.

     This variable is a normal hook. See *note Hooks: (elisp)Hooks.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker selection,  Next: Syntax checker configuration,  Prev: Syntax checking,  Up: Usage

2.3 Syntax checker selection
============================

By default Flycheck selects a *note suitable syntax checker: 19.
automatically from *note flycheck-checkers: 25, with respect to *note
flycheck-disabled-checkers: 26.:

 -- User Option: flycheck-checkers
     A list of *note syntax checker: 27.s available for automatic
     syntax checker selection.  An item in this list is a *note
     registered syntax checker: 28.

     You may modify this list, but you should normally not need to.
     Instead, it is intended for 3rd party extensions to tell Flycheck
     about new syntax checkers.

 -- User Option: flycheck-disabled-checkers
     A list of *note syntax checker: 27.s explicitly excluded from
     automatic selection.

     Change this list to disable syntax checkers which you do not want
     to use.  You may also use this option as a file or directory local
     variable to disable specific checkers in individual files and
     directories respectively.

A syntax checker in *note flycheck-checkers: 25. and *not* in *note
flycheck-disabled-checkers: 26. is an *note enabled syntax checker: 29.

Flycheck uses the first enabled and suitable syntax checker for the
current buffer.  See `Languages and syntax checkers' for a list of all
available syntax checkers.

If no *note suitable syntax checker: 19. is found, the syntax check is
_silently_ omitted.  _No_ error is signalled.  Only a special indicator
in the mode line informs about the omitted syntax check.  See `Mode
line' for details.

You can manually select a specific syntax checker for the current
buffer, too:

 -- Command: C-c ! s
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-select-checker
     Select the syntax checker for the current buffer by setting *note
     flycheck-checker: 2b, and run a syntax check with the new syntax
     checker.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and set *note flycheck-checker: 2b.

     Any *note syntax checker: 27. can be selected with this command,
     regardless of whether it is enabled.

 -- Command: C-u C-c ! s
 -- Command: C-u M-x flycheck-select-checker
     Deselect the current syntax checker, and run a syntax check with an
     automatically selected syntax checker.

     Set *note flycheck-checker: 2b. to `nil'.

 -- Variable: flycheck-checker
     The *note syntax checker: 27. to use for the current buffer.

     The variable is buffer local, and safe as file local variable for
     registered checkers.

     If set to `nil', automatically select a suitable syntax checker.

     If set to a *note syntax checker: 27, only use this syntax
     checker.  Automatic selection as described above is _disabled_.
     If the syntax checker not suitable, signal an error.

     You may directly set this variable without *note
     flycheck-select-checker: 2a, e.g. via file local variables.  For
     instance, you can use the following file local variable within a
     Python file to always use `pylint' for the file:

         # Local Variables:
         # flycheck-checker: python-pylint
         # End:

     See *note Specifying File Variables: (emacs)Specifying File
     Variables. for more information about file variables.

You can change the completion system used by *note
flycheck-select-checker: 2a.:

 -- User Option: flycheck-completion-system
     The completion system to use.

    `ido'
          Use IDO.

          IDO is a built-in alternative completion system, without good
          flex matching and a powerful UI.  You may want to install
          flx-ido(1) to improve the flex matching in IDO.

    `grizzl'
          Use Grizzl(2).

          Grizzl is an alternative completion system with powerful flex
          matching, but a very limited UI.

    `nil'
          Use the standard unfancy `completing-read'.

          `completing-read' has a very simple and primitive UI, and
          does not offer flex matching.  This is the default setting,
          though, to match Emacs' defaults.  With this system, you may
          want enable `icomplete-mode' to improve the display of
          completion candidates at least.

Each syntax checker provides documentation with information about the
executable the syntax checker uses, in which buffers it will be used
for syntax checks, and whether it can be configured.  See
`Configuration', for more information about syntax checker
configuration.

 -- Command: C-c ! ?
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-describe-checker
     Show the documentation of a syntax checker.

* Syntax checker options::
* Syntax checker configuration files::


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker executables,  Next: Syntax checker options,  Up: Syntax checker configuration

2.4.1 Syntax checker executables
--------------------------------

For each syntax checker, there is a buffer-local, customizable variable
`flycheck-CHECKER-executable', where CHECKER is the name of the syntax
checker.

The value of this variable is either nil, or a string.  In the former
case, Flycheck uses the default executable from the syntax checker
definition when executing the syntax checker.  In the latter case, it
uses the value of the variable as executable.

Use these variables to override the executable from the definition per
buffer.  For instance, you could use a different Emacs version with the
`emacs-lisp' or `emacs-lisp-checkdoc'.

You can either set these variables directly in your `init.el', or change
them interactively:

 -- Command: C-c ! e
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-set-checker-executable
     Set the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and an executable file, and set the
     executable variable of the syntax checker.

 -- Command: C-u C-c ! e
 -- Command: C-u M-x flycheck-set-checker-executable
     Reset the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and reset its executable to the
     default.

2.4.2 Syntax checker options
----------------------------

Some syntax checkers can be configured via options.  The following
options are provided by Flycheck (in Emacs, use `C-h v' or `M-x
describe-variable' on the variable name for detailed help):

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-definitions
     Additional preprocessor definitions for *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-include-path
     Include search path for *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-includes
     Additional include files for *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-language-standard
     The language standard for *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-ms-extensions
     Whether to enable Microsoft extensions in *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-no-rtti
     Whether to disable RTTI in *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-standard-library
     The standard library to use for *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-clang-warnings
     Additional warnings to enable in *note c/c++-clang: 34.

 -- User Option: flycheck-cppcheck-checks
     Additional checks to use in *note c/c++-cppcheck: 3d.

 -- User Option: flycheck-dmd-include-path
     Include search path for *note d-dmd: 3f.

 -- User Option: flycheck-emacs-lisp-initialize-packages
     Whether to initialize packages (see `package-initialize') before
     invoking the byte compiler in the *note emacs-lisp: 41. syntax
     checker.

     When `nil', never initialize packages.  When `auto', initialize
     packages only when checking files from the user's Emacs
     configuration in `user-emacs-directory'.  For any other non-nil
     value, always initialize packages.

 -- User Option: flycheck-emacs-lisp-load-path
     The `load-path' to use while checking with *note emacs-lisp: 41.

     The directory of the file being checked is always added to
     `load-path', regardless of the value of this variable.

     Note that changing this variable can lead to wrong results of the
     syntax check, e.g. if an unexpected version of a required library
     is used.

 -- User Option: flycheck-emacs-lisp-package-user-dir

2.4.3 Syntax checker configuration files
----------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers also read configuration files, denoted by
associated _configuration file variables_:

 -- User Option: flycheck-chktexrc
     The configuration file for the *note tex-chktex: 62. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-coffeelintrc
     The configuration file for the *note coffee-coffeelint: 64. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-eslintrc
     The configuration file for the *note javascript-eslint: 45. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-flake8rc
     The configuration file for the *note python-flake8: 47. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-gjslintrc
     The configuration file for the *note javascript-gjslint: 68. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-jshintrc
     The configuration file for the *note javascript-jshint: 6a. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-pylintrc
     The configuration file for the *note python-pylint: 6c. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-rubocoprc
     The configuration file for the *note ruby-rubocop: 56. syntax
     checker.

 -- User Option: flycheck-tidyrc
     The configuration file for the *note html-tidy: 6f. syntax checker.

The value of these variables is either a string or `nil'.  In the
former case, locate the configuration file using the functions in *note
flycheck-locate-config-file-functions: 70.:

 -- User Option: flycheck-locate-config-file-functions
     Functions to locate syntax checker configuration files.

     Each function in this hook must accept two arguments: The value of
     the configuration file variable, and the syntax checker symbol.
     It must return either a string with an absolute path to the
     configuration file, or nil, if it cannot locate the configuration
     file.

     The functions in this hook are called in order of appearance,
     until a function returns non-nil.  The configuration file returned
     by that function is then given to the syntax checker if it exists.

With the default value of this variable, configuration files are
located by the following algorithm:

  1. If the configuration file variable contains a path a directory
     separator, expand the path against the buffer's default directory
     and use the resulting path as configuration file.

  2. If Projectile(1) is available and the current buffer is part of a
     project project, search the configuration file in the root
     directory of the project.

  3. If the buffer has a file name, search the buffer's directory and
     any ancestors thereof for the configuration file.

  4. Eventually attempt to locate the configuration file in the user's
     home directory.

If any of these steps succeeds, the subsequent steps are not executed.

If the configuration file is found, pass it to the syntax checker upon
invocation.

If the configuration file is not found, or if the value of the variable
is nil, invoke the syntax checker without a configuration file.

Customize these variables using `M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files'.  Use `flycheck-describe-checker' to find out
whether a syntax checker has a configuration file.

You may also use these variables as file-local variables.  For
instance, the following checks the Javascript file always with
`.jshintrc' from the parent directory:

    // Local variables:
    // flycheck-jshintrc: "../.jshintrc"
    // End:

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error reporting,  Next: Error navigation,  Prev: Syntax checker configuration,  Up: Usage

2.5 Error reporting
===================

Errors and warnings from a syntax checker are

   - reported in the mode line or in a popup buffer, depending on the
     length of the error messages,

   - indicated according to *note flycheck-indication-mode: 72,

   - and highlighted in the buffer with the corresponding faces,
     according to *note flycheck-highlighting-mode: 73.

 -- Face: flycheck-error
 -- Face: flycheck-warning
 -- Face: flycheck-info
     The faces to use to highlight errors, warnings and info messages
     respectively.

          Note: The default faces provided by GNU Emacs are ill-suited
          to highlight errors because these are relatively pale and do
          not specify a background color or underline.  Hence
          highlights are easily overlook and even *invisible* for white
          space.

     For best error highlighting customize these faces, or choose a
     color theme that has reasonable Flycheck faces.  For instance, the
     Solarized(1) and Zenburn(2) themes are known to have good Flycheck
     faces.

 -- User Option: flycheck-highlighting-mode
     This variable determines how to highlight errors:

    `columns'
          Highlights the error column.  If the error does not have a
          column, highlight the whole line.

    `symbols'
          Highlights the symbol at the error column, if there is any,
          otherwise behave like @code{columns}.  This is the default.

    `sexps'
          Highlights the expression at the error column, if there is
          any, otherwise behave like `columns'.  Note that this mode
          can be *very* slow in some major modes.

    `lines'
          Highlights the whole line of the error.

    `nil'
          Do not highlight errors at all.  However, errors will still
          be reported in the mode line and in error message popups, and
          indicated according to *note flycheck-indication-mode: 72.

 -- Face: flycheck-fringe-error
 -- Face: flycheck-fringe-warning
 -- Face: flycheck-fringe-info
     The faces of fringe indicators for errors, warnings and info
     messages respectively.

 -- User Option: flycheck-indication-mode
     This variable determines how to indicate errors:

     If set to `left-fringe' or `right-fringe', indicate errors and
     warnings in the left and right fringe respectively.

     If set to `nil', do not indicate errors.  Errors will still be
     reported in the mode line and in error message popups, and
     highlighted according to *note flycheck-highlighting-mode: 73.

You can also completely customize error processing by hooking into
Flycheck:

 -- Hook: flycheck-process-error-functions
     Functions to process errors.

     Each function in this hook must accept a single argument: The
     Flycheck error to process.  See *note Error API: 7b, for more
     information about Flycheck error objects.

     The functions in this hook are called in order of appearance,
     until a function returns non-nil.  Thus, a function in this hook
     may return nil, to allow for further processing of the error, or
     t, to indicate that the error was fully processed and inhibit any
     further processing.

If you hover a highlighted error with the mouse, a tooltip with the
top-most error message will be shown.

Flycheck also displays errors under point after a short delay:

 -- User Option: flycheck-display-errors-delay
     Delay in seconds before displaying errors at point.

     Use floating point numbers to express fractions of seconds.

The error is displayed via *note flycheck-display-errors-function: 7d.:

 -- User Option: flycheck-display-errors-function
     A function to display errors under point.

     If set to a function, call the function with a list of all errors
     to show.  If set to nil, to not display errors at all.

     The default function is *note flycheck-display-error-messages: 7e.

 -- Function: flycheck-display-error-messages errors
     Show the messages of the given `errors' in the echo area,
     separated by empty lines.  If the error messages are too long for
     the echo area, show the error messages in a popup buffer instead.

     The Emacs Lisp function `display-message-or-buffer' is used to
     show the messages.  Refer to the docstring of this function for
     details on when popup buffers are used, and how to customize its
     behaviour.

You can also work with the error messages at point, and copy them into
the kill ring or search them on Google:

 -- Command: C-c ! C-w
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-copy-messages-as-kill
     Copy all Flycheck error messages at the current point into kill
     ring.

 -- Command: C-c ! /
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-google-messages
     Google for all Flycheck error messages at the current point.

     If there are more than *note flycheck-google-max-messages: 81.
     errors at point, signal an error, to avoid spamming your browser
     with Google tabs.

     Requires the Google This(3) library, which is available on
     MELPA(4).

 -- User Option: flycheck-google-max-messages
     The maximum number of error messages to Google at once.

     If set to an integer, *note flycheck-google-messages: 80. will
     refuse to search, when there are more error messages than the
     value of this variable at point.

     If set to `nil', *note flycheck-google-messages: 80. will always
     search for *all* messages at point.  This setting is *not*
     recommended.

You can also show a list with all errors in the current buffer:

 -- Command: C-c ! l
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-list-errors
 -- Command: M-x list-flycheck-errors
     List all errors in the current buffer in a separate buffer.

     The error list automatically refreshes after a syntax check, and
     follows the current buffer and window, that is, if you switch to
     another buffer or window, the error list is updated to show the
     errors of the new buffer or window.

When you move the point in the current buffer while the error list is
visible, all errors at point and at the current line are highlighted in
the error list with *note flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point: 84.
and *note flycheck-error-list-highlight: 85. respectively.

 -- Face: flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point
     The face for highlighting the errors at point in the error list.

 -- Face: flycheck-error-list-highlight
     The face for highlighting the errors at the current line in the
     error list.

Ultimately, you can clear all reported errors at once:

 -- Command: C-c ! C
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-clear
     Clear all Flycheck errors and warnings in the current buffer.

     You should not normally need this command, because Flycheck checks
     the buffer periodically anyway.

2.6 Error navigation
====================

Flycheck integrates into standard error navigation commands of Emacs.
If *no* compilation buffer (including those from `M-x compile', `M-x
grep', `M-x occur', etc.) is visible, `M-g n' (`next-error') and `M-g p'
(`previous-error') will navigate between Flycheck warnings and errors
in the current buffer.  See *note Compilation Mode: (emacs)Compilation
Mode. for more information about these commands.

You can disable this integration by setting *note
flycheck-standard-error-navigation: 89. to nil:

 -- User Option: flycheck-standard-error-navigation
     If non-nil, enable navigation of Flycheck errors with the standard
     `next-error' and friends.

     Otherwise, do not integrate in standard error navigation, and let
     these functions only navigate compilation mode errors.

     Changes to this variable only take effect after re-enabling *note
     Flycheck Mode: 14. with *note flycheck-mode: 16. again.

Visible compilation buffers take precedence over Flycheck navigation.
If such a buffer is visible, `M-g n' and `M-g p' will ignore Flycheck
errors and warnings, and navigate errors (or generally results)
reported by the compilation buffer instead.

To address this issue, Flycheck provides independent error navigation
commands, which are not affected by *note
flycheck-standard-error-navigation: 89.:

 -- Command: C-c ! n
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-next-error
     Jump to the next Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards by as many errors as specified
     by the prefix argument, e.g. `M-3 C-c ! n' will move to the 3rd
     error from the current point.

 -- Command: C-c ! p
 -- Command: M-x flycheck-previous-error
     Jump to the previous Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump backwards by as many errors as
     specified by the prefix argument, e.g. `M-3 C-c ! p' will move to
     the 3rd previous error from the current point.

 -- Command: M-x flycheck-first-error
     Jump to the first Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards to by as many errors as
     specified by the prefix argument, e.g. `M-3 M-x
     flycheck-first-error' moves to the 3rd error from the beginning of
     the buffer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Mode line,  Prev: Error navigation,  Up: Usage

2.7 Mode line
=============

Flycheck indicates its state in the mode line:

`FlyC'
     There are no errors in the current buffer.

`FlyC*'
     A syntax check is being performed currently.

`FlyC:3/4'
     There are three errors and four warnings in the current buffer.

`FlyC-'
     Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable syntax
     checker.  See *note Syntax checker selection: 20. for more
     information.

`FlyC!'
     The syntax check failed.  Inspect the `*Messages*' buffer for
     details.

`FlyC?'
     The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the
     syntax checker may be flawed.  Inspect the `*Messages*' buffer for
     details.

     This indicator should *never* be displayed for built-in syntax
     checkers.  If it is, please report an issue to the Flycheck
     developers, as by *note Reporting issues: 8f.

3.1 Defining new syntax checkers
================================

You define new syntax checkers with *note flycheck-define-checker: 94.:

 -- Macro: flycheck-define-checker symbol docstring &rest properties
     Define SYMBOL as new syntax checker with DOCSTRING and PROPERTIES.

     DOCSTRING provides documentation for the syntax checker.  Use
     *note flycheck-describe-checker: 10. to view the documentation of
     a syntax checker.

     The following PROPERTIES constitute a syntax checker.  *note
     ;command: 95. is mandatory.  A syntax checker must also have
     either *note ;modes: 96. or *note ;predicate: 97, and either *note
     ;error-patterns: 98. or *note ;error-parser: 99.  *note
     ;next-checkers: 9a. is entirely optional.

     If a mandatory property is missing, or if any property has an
     invalid value, a _compile-time_ error is signalled.

     Any syntax checker defined with this macro is eligible for manual
     syntax checker selection with *note flycheck-select-checker: 2a.
     To make the new syntax checker available for automatic selection,
     you need to register it in *note flycheck-checkers: 25.  See *note
     Syntax checker selection: 20. for more information.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :command (_executable_
               [_arg_ ...])
               An unquoted list describing the syntax checker command
               to execute.

               EXECUTABLE must be a string with the executable of this
               syntax checker.

               A customizable, buffer-local variable
               `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable' is implicitly defined to
               allow overriding of the executable.  See *note Syntax
               checker executables: 2e. for details about these
               variables.  If this variable is non-nil, Flycheck uses
               the value of the variable as executable, otherwise it
               falls back to EXECUTABLE.  In either case, the
               executable is checked with `executable-find' before use.

               Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as
               string, or as one of the following special symbols and
               forms.

                    Note: These special forms and symbols do *not*
                    apply recursively.  Within the body of a cell or
                    the result of the `eval' form, special forms and
                    symbols are *not* replaced!

         `source'
               The file to check.

               This file is a temporary file with the contents of the
               buffer to check, created in the system's temporary
               directory.

               If the buffer to check has a file name, the
               non-directory component of the name of the temporary
               file will be the same as in the buffer's file name, to
               support languages which enforce specific rules on the
               file name (e.g. the file must be named after the
               containing feature, class, etc.).

               If the buffer to check has no file name, the name of the
               temporary file is random.

               This symbol is the *preferred* way to pass the input
               file to your syntax checker.

         `source-inplace'
               The file to check.

               This file is a temporary file with the contents of the
               buffer to check, created *in the same directory* as the
               buffer's file.  The name of the file is random.

               If the buffer has no file name, this symbol is
               equivalent to `source'.

               This symbol should be used if and only if the syntax
               check *needs other files* from the source directory
               (e.g. include files in C, or Python modules).

         `source-original'
               The file name of the current buffer, as by
               `buffer-file-name', or an empty string, if the buffer
               has no file name.

               This symbol is provided to *additionally* pass the real
               name of the file to check to a syntax checker.

               It should *never* be used as primary input to the syntax
               checker, unless both `source' and `source-original' are
               absolutely not applicable.  In this case, be sure to add
               a predicate to your syntax checker that inhibits the
               syntax check, if the buffer has no file name, or was
               modified, for otherwise the syntax check will fail or
               return out-dated errors:

                   :predicate (lambda () (and (buffer-file-name)
                                              (not (buffer-modified-p)))

         `temporary-directory'
               The path to an existing temporary directory, which is
               unique on each execution of the syntax checker.

               Use this symbol if you need to move files created by a
               syntax checker out of the way.

               See the declaration of the *note elixir: 9b. syntax
               checker for an application of this symbol.

         `temporary-file-name'
               The path to a temporary file, which is unique on each
               execution of the syntax checker.  The file is @emph{not}
               created automatically.

               Use this symbol if you need to move files created by a
               syntax checker out of the way.

               See the declaration of the @code{go-build} syntax
               checker for an application of this symbol.

         `(config-file OPTION VARIABLE)'
               A configuration file for this syntax checker.

               OPTION is a string containing the option that specifies a
               configuration file to the syntax checker tool.

               VARIABLE is a symbol referring to a variable from which
               to obtain the name or path of the configuration file.
               See *note Syntax checker configuration files: 60. for
               more information about syntax checker configuration.
               You need to define this variable _explicitly_ with *note
               flycheck-def-config-file-var: 9c.

               If the configuration file is found, pass the OPTION and
               the absolute path to the configuration file to the
               syntax checker.  Otherwise the cell is simply dropped
               from the arguments of the syntax checker.

               If OPTION ends with a `=' character, OPTION and the
               absolute path to the configuration file are concatenated
               and given as a single argument to the syntax checker.
               Otherwise, OPTION and the configuration file path are
               given as two separate arguments.

         `(option OPTION VARIABLE [FILTER])'
               The value of a variable.

               OPTION is a string containing the option for with to
               specify the value.  FILTER is an optional function to be
               applied to the value of VARIABLE before use.  See *note
               Option filters: 9d. for a list of built-in option
               filters.

               VARIABLE is a symbol referring to a variable whose value
               to use.  :See ref:`syntax-checker-configuration' for
               more information about :syntax checker configuration.
               You need to define this variable :_explicitly_ with
               *note flycheck-def-option-var: 9e.

               If VARIABLE is not `nil' after applying FILTER, pass
               OPTION and the value of VARIABLE after applying FILTER.
               Otherwise the cell is simply dropped from the arguments
               of the syntax checker.

               An OPTION ending with a `=' character is treated like in
               a `config-file' cell.

         `(option-list OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])'
               Like OPTION, but for lists of options.

               OPTION is a string containing the option to specify.

               VARIABLE is a variable whose value must be a list.

               `prepend-fn' is a function called with OPTION as first
               and the item of the list as second argument.  It should
               return the result of prepending OPTION to the item,
               either as list or as string.  If omitted, it defaults to
               `list', so by default, OPTION will be prepended as a
               separate argument.

               FILTER is an optional function to be applied to each
               item in the list before use.  See *note Option filters:
               9d. for a list of built-in option filters.

               For each item in the value of VARIABLE, which is not
               `nil' after applying FILTER, pass OPTION the the item
               after applying FILTER, as returned by PREPEND-FN.

               Nil items are simply ignored.

         `(option-flag OPTION VARIABLE)'
               Like `option', but for boolean flags.

               OPTION is a string containing the option to specify.
               `variable' is a symbol referring to a variable.

               If VARIABLE is non-nil, pass OPTION to the syntax
               checker.  Otherwise just ignore this argument.

         `(eval FORM)'
               The result of evaluating `form'.

               FORM is an arbitrary Emacs Lisp form.  It is evaluated
               literally _each time_ the syntax checker is executed.
               Special forms and symbols in FORM are _not_ replaced!

               FORM must evaluate either to a string, a list of strings
               or nil.  For any other result, signal an error.

               If the result of FORM is not nil, pass the result to the
               syntax checker _literally_.  Special symbols and forms
               in the result of FORM are _not_ replaced.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :error-patterns ((_level_
               _sexp_) ...)
          An unquoted list of one or more error patterns to parse the
          output of the syntax checker *note ;command: 95.

          LEVEL is a Flycheck error level, and denotes the severity of
          errors matched by the pattern.  This mainly affects the
          visual representation of matched errors in buffers.

          Flycheck provides the built-in error levels `error',
          `warning' and `info'.  You can define your own error levels
          with *note flycheck-define-error-level: 9f.

          The LEVEL is followed by one or more `rx' SEXP elements.  See
          the docstring of the function `rx' for more information.  In
          addition to the standard forms of `rx', Flycheck supports the
          following additional forms to make specific parts of the
          error output available to Flycheck:

         `line'
               Matches the line number the error refers to, as a
               sequence of one or more digits.

         `column'
               Matches a column number the error refers to, as a
               sequence of one or more digits.

         `(file-name SEXP ...)'
               Matches the file name the error refers to.  SEXP matches
               the name of the file.  If no SEXP is given, use a
               default body of `(minimal-match (one-or-more
               not-newline))', which is equivalent to `".+?"'.

         `(message SEXP ...)'
               Matches the error message to be shown to the user.  SEXP
               matches the text of the message.  If no SEXP is given,
               use a default body of `(one-or-more not-newline)', which
               is equivalent to `".+"'.

          Each of these items is optional, however error messages
          without a `line' will be ignored and are not shown in the
          buffer.

          The patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
          whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
          by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
          other words, the first pattern wins.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :error-parser _function_
      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :error-parser (lambda
               (output checker buffer) _body_ ...)
          A function to parse the output of the syntax checker, either
          as _unquoted_ function symbol or `lambda' form.

          The function must accept three arguments OUTPUT, CHECKER and
          BUFFER, where OUTPUT is the output of the syntax checker as
          string, CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER
          a buffer object representing the checker buffer.

          The function must return a list of *note flycheck-error: a0.
          objects parsed from OUTPUT.  See *note Error API: 7b. for
          information about *note flycheck-error: a0.  See *note Error
          parsers: a1. for a list of built-in error parsers.

          If this property is given, it takes precedence over *note
          ;error-patterns: 98.  To use an error parser together with
          patterns, you must manually call *note
          flycheck-parse-with-patterns: a2. in your error parser to
          apply the error patterns.  You can then manipulate the *note
          flycheck-error: a0. objects returned by this function.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :modes _mode_
      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :modes (_mode_ ...)
          An unquoted major mode symbol or an unquoted list thereof.

          If given, this syntax checker is only used, if the major mode
          of the buffer to check is equal (as in `eq') to any given
          MODE.

          If *note ;predicate: 97. is given, it is additionally called
          in buffers of any given MODE.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :predicate _function_
      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :predicate (lambda () _body_
               ...)
          A function to determines whether to use this syntax checker
          in the current buffer, either as unquoted function symbol or
          as `lambda' form.  The syntax checker is only used if this
          function returns non-nil when called in the buffer to check.

          If *note ;modes: 96. is given, the function is only called in
          matching major modes.  Thus, if *note ;modes: 96. and *note
          ;predicate: 97. are given, *both* must match for this syntax
          checker to be used.

      -- Flycheck Syntax Checker Property: :next-checkers (_item_ ...)
          An unquoted list defining the syntax checker to run after
          this checker.

          Flycheck tries all items in the order of declaration.  Each
          ITEM is either a syntax checker symbol or a cons cell
          `(PREDICATE . CHECKER)'.

          In the former case, the ITEM is used, if the syntax checker is
          enabled and suitable for the current buffer.  In the latter
          case, the PREDICATE must match additionally.

          PREDICATE is either `no-errors' or `warnings-only':

         `no-errors'
               The syntax CHECKER is only considered if the current
               syntax checker reported no errors at all.

         `warnings-only'
               The syntax CHECKER is only considered if the current
               syntax checker only reported warnings, but no errors.

 -- Macro: flycheck-def-config-file-var symbol checker &optional
          filename
     Define SYMBOL as configuration file variable for a syntax CHECKER,
     with a default value of FILENAME.

     SYMBOL is declared as customizable, buffer-local variable using
     `defcustom', to provide a configuration file for the given syntax
     CHECKER.  The variable has the customization type STRING, :and
     gets a comprehensive docstring, including a reference to CHECKER.

     FILENAME is used as initial value for the variable.  If omitted,
     the initial value is nil.

     Use this macro together with the `config-file' form in the *note
     ;command: 95. of a syntax checker.

 -- Macro: flycheck-def-option-var symbol initial-value checker
          &optional custom-args
     Define SYMBOL as option variable for a syntax CHECKER, with the
     given INITIAL-VALUE.

     SYMBOL is declared as customizable variable, buffer-local variable
     using `defcustom', to provide an option for the given syntax
     CHECKER.  SYMBOL gets a comprehensive docstring, including a
     reference to CHECKER.

     CUSTOM-ARGS are forwarded to `defcustom'.  Use them to declare the
     customization type, etc.

     Use this macro together with the `option', `option-list' and
     `option-flag' forms in the *note ;command: 95. of a syntax checker.

3.2 Registering new syntax checkers
===================================

After a syntax checker was defined, it should be registered for
automatic selection, by adding it to *note flycheck-checkers: 25, e.g.

    (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'my-new-syntax-checker)

     Note: *note flycheck-checker: 2b. and *note
     flycheck-select-checker: 2a. are reserved for *user
     customization*.  Do *not* use them in Flycheck extensions.

     Specifically, please do *not* provide a hook function which
     selects the syntax checker explicitly by assigning to *note
     flycheck-checker: 2b. or by calling *note flycheck-select-checker:
     2a, e.g.

         (defun enable-my-new-syntax-checker ()
           (setq flycheck-checker 'my-new-syntax-checker)
           (flycheck-buffer))

         (add-hook 'my-major-mode-hook #'enable-my-new-syntax-checker)

     This circumvents the entire automatic selection of Flycheck, and
     prevents the user from effectively customizing Flycheck.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error levels,  Next: Error parsers,  Prev: Registering new syntax checkers,  Up: Extending Flycheck

3.3 Error levels
================

Flycheck provides some built-in error levels:

`error'
     Severe errors which cannot be ignored

`warning'
     Potential errors which can be ignored

`info'
     Informational annotations

You can define new error levels with *note flycheck-define-error-level:
9f.:

 -- Function: flycheck-define-error-level level &rest properties
     Define a new error `level' with `properties'.

     The following `properties' constitute an error level:

    `:overlay-category CATEGORY'
          The overlay CATEGORY for `level' as symbol.

          An overlay category is a symbol whose properties provide the
          default values for overlays of this category.  See *note
          Overlay Properties: (elisp)Overlay Properties. for more
          information about overlay properties and categories.

          A category for an error level overlay should at least define
          the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Other useful
          properties for error level categories are `priority' to
          influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays, and
          `help-echo' to define a default error messages for errors
          without messages.

    `:fringe-face FACE'
          A FACE to use for fringe indicators for `level' as symbol.

    `:fringe-bitmap BITMAP'
          A fringe BITMAP to use for fringe indicators for `level' as
          symbol.

          See *note Fringe Bitmaps: (elisp)Fringe Bitmaps. for a list
          of built-in fringe bitmaps, and instructions on how to define
          new bitmaps.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error parsers,  Next: Option filters,  Prev: Error levels,  Up: Extending Flycheck

3.4 Error parsers
=================

Syntax checkers may use more sophisticated error parsing by using the
*note ;error-parser: 99. property.  See *note Defining new syntax
checkers: b. for information about syntax checker definition.

Flycheck provides the following error parsers for use by syntax
checkers:

 -- Function: flycheck-parse-with-patterns output checker buffer
     Parse OUTPUT with the *note ;error-patterns: 98. of the syntax
     CHECKER.

 -- Function: flycheck-parse-checkstyle output checker buffer
     Parse OUTPUT as Checkstyle(1) XML.

You may also define your own error parsers.  An error parser is any
function that takes the following three arguments and returns a list of
*note flycheck-error: a0. objects (see *note Error API: 7b. for more
information):

`output'
     The complete output of the syntax checker as string.

`checker'
     A symbol denoting the executed syntax checker.

`buffer'
     A buffer object referring to the buffer that was syntax-checked.

Flycheck provides some utility functions to implement your own error
parsers.  See *note Error parser API: a9.

3.5 Option filters
==================

Flycheck provides the following built-in option filters for use with the
`option', `option-list' and `option-flag' forms in the *note ;command:
95. of a syntax checker definition:

 -- Function: flycheck-option-int value
     Like the built-in `number-to-string', but returns `nil' when VALUE
     is `nil'.

 -- Function: flycheck-option-comma-separated-list value &optional
          separator filter
     Convert VALUE into a list separated by SEPARATOR.  FILTER is an
     optional function to apply to each item in VALUE first.

3.6 Extending syntax checkers
=============================

There are some means to extend defined syntax checkers:

 -- Function: flycheck-add-next-checker checker next-checker &optional
          append
     Add a NEXT-CHECKER to run after CHECKER.

     CHECKER is a syntax checker symbol.  NEXT-CHECKER is either a
     syntax checker symbol or a cons cell in the format of a single
     entry to the *note ;next-checkers: 9a. property.

     NEXT-CHECKER is prepended before other checkers to run after
     CHECKER, unless APPEND is non-nil.

3.7.1 Basic syntax checkers
---------------------------

As explained in the previous chapter *note Defining new syntax
checkers: b, a syntax checker is declared with *note
flycheck-define-checker: 94.

We will use this function to define a syntax checker using the PHP
CodeSniffer utility for the PHP programming language:

    (flycheck-define-checker php-phpcs
      "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer.

    See URL `http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/'."
      :command ("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle" source)
      :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
      :modes php-mode)

    (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'php-phpcs)

First we specify the *note ;command: 95. to execute.  The first element
of the command list is the name of the executable, `phpcs' in our case.
This command is checked for existence with `executable-find' before
using this syntax checker.  If the command does not exist, the syntax
checker is _not_ used.

The executable is following by the arguments, in this case some options
and the symbol `source'.  This symbol is replaced with the file to
check.  This file is a temporary file created in the system temporary
directory and containing the contents of the buffer to check.

Next we specify how to parse the output of the syntax checker.  PHP
CodeSniffer provides an option to output errors in an XML format
similar to the Java tool Checkstyle, so we use the built-in _error
parser_ *note flycheck-parse-checkstyle: a8. to parse the output.

Then we enable the syntax checker in PHP editing modes.

Ultimately, we make the new syntax checker available for automatic
selection by adding it to *note flycheck-checkers: 25.

If the syntax checker does not provide any sort of structured output
format, we have to parse the error messages from the textual output.
To do so, we can use _error patterns_, like in the Pylint syntax
checker for the Python programming language:

    (flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
      "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

    See URL `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint'."
      :command ("epylint" source-inplace)
      :error-patterns
      ((warning line-start (file-name) ":" line
                ": Warning (W" (zero-or-more not-newline) "): "
                (message) line-end)
       (error line-start (file-name) ":" line
              ": Error (E" (zero-or-more not-newline) "): "
              (message) line-end)
       (error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": [F] " (message) line-end))
      :modes python-mode)

Again, there is a *note ;command: 95, however we use the
`source-inplace' symbol this time.  This symbol causes the temporary
file to be created in the same directory as the original file, making
information from the source code tree available to the syntax checker.
In case of Pylint, these are the Python packages from the source code
tree.

Next we give the list of *note ;error-patterns: 98. to parse errors.
These patterns extract the error location and the error message from
the output of `epylint'.  An error pattern is a list containing a
regular expression with match groups to extract the error information,
and an error level.

Eventually we enable the syntax checker in `python-mode'.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checkers with predicates,  Next: Configuration files for syntax checkers,  Prev: Basic syntax checkers,  Up: Examples

3.7.2 Syntax checkers with predicates
-------------------------------------

In the previous examples the syntax checkers were specific to certain
major modes.  However, this is not always the case.  For instance, GNU
Emacs provides a single mode only for shell scripting in various Shell
languages.  A syntax checker for a specific shell must check whether
the edited shell script is written for the right shell:

    (flycheck-define-checker zsh
      "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

    See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
      :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
      :error-patterns
      ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": " (message) line-end))
      :modes sh-mode
      :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh)))

This syntax checker for the Zsh shell is enabled in `sh-mode' as
specified by *note ;modes: 96, however it specifies an additional *note
;predicate: 97. to determine whether the right shell is in use.  Hence
this syntax checker is only used if a Zsh shell scripting is being
edited in `sh-mode', but not if a Bash or POSIX Shell script is being
edited.

A syntax checker may even go as far as not having *note ;modes: 96. at
all.  For instance, there is no special JSON mode, but syntax checking
JSON is still desirable.  Hence a JSON syntax checker may use the *note
;predicate: 97. to check the file extension:

    (flycheck-define-checker json-jsonlint
      "A JSON syntax and style checker using jsonlint.

    See URL `https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint'."
      :command ("jsonlint" "-c" "-q" source)
      :error-patterns
      ((error line-start
              (file-name)
              ": line " line
              ", col " column ", "
              (message) line-end))
      :predicate
      (lambda ()
        (or
         (eq major-mode 'json-mode)
         (and buffer-file-name
              (string= "json" (file-name-extension buffer-file-name))))))

This syntax checker is now used whenever a file ends with `.json',
regardless of the major mode.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Configuration files for syntax checkers,  Next: Chaining syntax checkers,  Prev: Syntax checkers with predicates,  Up: Examples

3.7.3 Configuration files for syntax checkers
---------------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers can be configured using configuration files given
by an option.  Flycheck provides built-in support to handle such
configuration files:

    (flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-jshintrc javascript-jshint ".jshintrc")

    (flycheck-define-checker javascript-jshint
      "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

    See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
      :command ("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter"
                (config-file "--config" flycheck-jshintrc) source)
      :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
      :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))

As you can see, we define a syntax checker for Javascript, using the
`jshint' utility.  This utility accepts a configuration file via the
`--config' option.

To use a configuration file with jshint, we first declare the variable
`flycheck-jshintrc' that provides the name of the file, as explained in
*note Syntax checker configuration files: 60.

In the *note ;command: 95. we use a `config-file' form to pass the
configuration file to the syntax checker.  If the configuration file is
found, its path will be passed to the syntax checker, using the option
specified after the `config-file' symbol.  Otherwise the whole element
is simply omitted from the command line.

Some Syntax checkers can also be configured using options passed on the
command line.  Flycheck supports this case, too.  We will use this
facility to extend the PHP CodeSniffer syntax checker from the *note
Basic syntax checkers: b2. section with support for coding standards:

    (flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-phpcs-standard nil phpcs
      "The coding standard for PHP CodeSniffer."
      :type '(choice (const :tag "Default standard" nil)
                     (string :tag "Standard name" nil)))
    (put 'flycheck-phpcs-standard 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)

    (flycheck-declare-checker php-phpcs
      "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer."
      :command '("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle"
                 (option "--standard=" flycheck-phpcs-standard)
                 source)
      :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
      :modes 'php-mode)

The syntax checker is pretty much the same as before, except that a new
element was added to *note ;command: 95.  This element passes the value
of the new option variable *note flycheck-phpcs-standard: 51. to the
syntax checker.  This variable is declared with the special macro *note
flycheck-def-option-var: 9e. at the beginning.

3.7.4 Chaining syntax checkers
------------------------------

For many languages, more than a single syntax checker is applicable.
For instance, Emacs Lisp can be checked for syntactic corrections with
the byte code compiler, and for adherence to the Emacs Lisp
documentation style using Checkdoc.  PHP, too, can be syntax checked
with the PHP parser, and verified against coding styles using PHP
CodeSniffer.

To support such cases, syntax checkers can be _chained_ using the *note
;next-checkers: 9a.  The standard PHP syntax checker uses this to run
PHP CodeSniffer if there are no syntax errors:

    (flycheck-define-checker php
      "A PHP syntax checker using the PHP command line interpreter.

    See URL `http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php'."
      :command ("php" "-l" "-d" "error_reporting=E_ALL" "-d" "display_errors=1"
                "-d" "log_errors=0" source)
      :error-patterns
      ((error line-start (or "Parse" "Fatal" "syntax") " error" (any ":" ",") " "
              (message) " in " (file-name) " on line " line line-end))
      :modes (php-mode php+-mode)
      :next-checkers ((warnings-only . php-phpcs)))

Now PHP CodeSniffer will check the coding style, whenever a PHP syntax
check did not result in any errors, if PHP CodeSniffer syntax checker
is usable _and_ registered.

4 Flycheck API
**************

This chapter provides a brief overview over the Flycheck API.

You may use this API to extend Flycheck, e.g. by implementing new error
parsers or more in-depth error analysis.  You will also find this API
helpful if you want to develop Flycheck itself.

The documentation provided in this chapter is intended as brief
overview.  For a definite reference on functions and variables, please
consult the excellent online help system of Emcas, via
`describe-function' and `describe-variable' respectively.

4.1 Error API
=============

Flycheck errors are represented by the CL structure *note
flycheck-error: a0.  See *note Structures: (cl)Structures. for more
information about CL structures.

 -- CL Struct: flycheck-error
     A Flycheck error with the following slots.  Each of these slots
     may be `nil'.

      -- Slot: buffer
          The buffer object referring to the buffer this error belongs
          to.

               Note: You do not need to set this attribute when
               creating errors in an error parser.  Flycheck
               automatically keeps track of the buffer itself.

      -- Slot: checker
          The syntax checker that reported this error.

      -- Slot: filename
          A string containing the filename the error refers to.

      -- Slot: line
          An integer providing the line the error refers to.

      -- Slot: column
          An integer providing the column the error refers to.

          If this attribute is `nil', Flycheck will assume that the
          error refers to the whole line.

      -- Slot: message
          The human-readable error message as string.

      -- Slot: level
          The error level of the message, as symbol denoting an error
          level defined with *note flycheck-define-error-level: 9f.

     There are two constructors to create new *note flycheck-error: a0.
     objects:

      -- Function: flycheck-error-new-at line column &optional level
               message &key checker filename buffer
          Create a new Flycheck error at the given LINE and COLUMN.

          LINE and COLUMN refer to the *note line: bc. and *note
          column: bd. of the new error.  The optional LEVEL and MESSAGE
          arguments fill the *note level: bf. and cl-slot:`message'
          slots respectively.

          CHECKER, FILENAME and BUFFER are keyword arguments, for *note
          checker: ba, *note filename: bb. and *note buffer: b9.
          respectively.  BUFFER defaults to the current buffer, the
          other two default to `nil'.

               Warning: Due to a limitation of Common Lisp functions in
               Emacs Lisp, you must specify *all* optional arguments,
               that is, *both* LEVEL *and* MESSAGE, to pass any keyword
               arguments.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-new &rest attributes
          Create a new *note flycheck-error: a0. with the given
          ATTRIBUTES.

          ATTRIBUTES is a property list, where each property specifies
          the value for the corresponding slot of *note flycheck-error:
          a0, for instance:

              (flycheck-error-new :line 10 :column 5 :message "Foo" :level 'warning)

     The following functions and macros work on errors:

      -- Macro: flycheck-error-with-buffer error &rest forms
          Evaluate FORMS with the *note buffer: b9. of the given ERROR
          as the current buffer.

          If the buffer is not live, FORMS are *not* evaluated.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-line-region error
          Get the region marking the whole *note line: bc. of the given
          ERROR, as a cons cell `(BEG . END)'.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-column-region error
          Get the region marking the *note column: bd. of the given
          ERROR, as cons cell `(BEG . END)'.

          If the *note column: bd. of ERROR is `nil', return `nil'
          instead.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-sexp-region error
          Get the region marking the expression around the *note
          column: bd. of the ERROR, as cons cell `(BEG . END)'.

          If the *note column: bd. of ERROR is `nil', or if there is no
          expression around this column, return `nil' instead.

               Warning: Flycheck relies on the major mode to parse the
               expression around the column.  As such, the major mode
               must implement support for this feature.

               Some major modes, especially from 3rd party packages, do
               not support this feature at all, or only very poorly.
               Others (for instance `python-mode') exhibit serious
               performance drops in some cases.

               Use this function with care, and at best only in major
               modes which are known to have good support for this
               feature.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-pos error
          Get the exact buffer position of ERROR.

          Essentially this is the position of the *note column: bd. of
          ERROR, if it is not `nil', or the position of the first
          non-whitespace character on the *note line: bc. of ERROR
          otherwise.

      -- Function: flycheck-error-format error
          Format ERROR as a human-readable string.

The following functions and variables may be used to analyze the errors
of a syntax check.

 -- Variable: flycheck-current-errors
     This buffer-local variable stores the errors of the last syntax
     check, sorted by line and column number.

 -- Function: flycheck-count-errors errors
     Count the number of errors and warnings in ERRORS.

     Return an alist mapping error level symbols to error counts.  Each
     item is a cons cell `(LEVEL . COUNT)', where `LEVEL' is the level
     symbol and `COUNT' is the number of errors of of `LEVEL'.

 -- Function: flycheck-has-errors-p errors &optional level
     Determine if there are any ERRORS with the given LEVEL.

     If LEVEL is omitted, determine whether ERRORS is not nil.
     Otherwise determine whether there are any errors whose level is
     equal to the given LEVEL.

4.2 Error parser API
====================

These functions can be used to implement custom error parsers:

 -- Function: flycheck-parse-xml-string s
     Parse a string S containing XML and return the parsed document
     tree.

   - Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest code.

   - Be clear and precise (do not prose, but name functions and
     commands exactly).

   - Include the version of Flycheck as shown by `M-x flycheck-version'.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: General,  Next: Code style,  Up: Contributing code

5.2.1 General
-------------

   - Write good and _complete_ code.

   - Provide use cases and rationale for new features.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Code style,  Next: Commit messages,  Prev: General,  Up: Contributing code

5.2.2 Code style
----------------

   - Generally, use the same coding style and spacing.

   - Do not use tabs for indentation.

   - Add docstrings for every declaration.

   - Make sure your code compiles without warnings with `make compile',
     and has no checkdoc issues with `M-x checkdoc-buffer' or `C-c ?
     d'.  If you are using Flycheck, just make sure that your code has
     no Flycheck warnings.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Commit messages,  Next: Contributing syntax checkers,  Prev: Code style,  Up: Contributing code

5.2.3 Commit messages
---------------------

Write commit messages according to Tim Pope's guidelines(1). In short:

   - Start with a capitalized, short (50 characters or less) summary,
     followed by a blank line.

   - If necessary, add one or more paragraphs with details, wrapped at
     72 characters.

   - Use present tense and write in the imperative: “Fix bug”, not
     “fixed bug” or “fixes bug”.

   - Separate paragraphs by blank lines.

   - Do _not_ use special markup (e.g. Markdown).  Commit messages are
     plain text.  You may use `*emphasis*' or `_underline_' though,
     following conventions established on mailing lists.

This is a model commit message:

    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
    characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
    line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
    the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
    two together.

    Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
    or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
    by commands like git merge and git revert.

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too

    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
      single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

    - Use a hanging indent

Git Commit Mode(2) and Magit(3) provide a major mode for Git commit
messages, which helps you to comply to these guidelines.

5.2.4 Contributing syntax checkers
----------------------------------

For syntax checkers, some special guidelines apply in addition to the
above:

   - Provide a link to the website of the syntax checker tool in the
     comments of your pull request.

   - Add a proper docstring to your syntax checker, including this URL.

Additionally, either

   - show example code that triggers errors for each of the error
     patterns of the syntax checker, or

   - add unit tests for your syntax checker.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Pull requests,  Prev: Contributing syntax checkers,  Up: Contributing code

5.2.5 Pull requests
-------------------

   - Use a *topic branch* to easily amend a pull request later, if
     necessary.

   - Do *not* open new pull requests, when asked to improve your patch.
     Instead, amend your commits with `git rebase -i', and then update
     the pull request with `git push --force'

   - Open a pull request(1) that relates to but one subject with a
     clear title and description in grammatically correct, complete
     sentences.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: master in development,  Next: 0 17 Feb 1 2014,  Up: Changes

7.1 master (in development)
===========================

   - *Breaking changes*:

        - The POSIX script syntax checkers `sh-bash' and `sh-dash' were
          renamed to `sh-posix-bash' and `sh-posix-dash' respectively.
          The `bash' and `zsh' syntax checkers were renamed to
          `sh-bash' and `sh-zsh' respectively.  Thus, all shell script
          syntax checkers now live in the `sh-' prefix.

        - `rst-sphinx' requires Sphinx 1.2 or newer now.

   - New syntax checkers:

        - #88(1): Perl with Perl Critic

        - #322(2): Replace GNU Make with POSIX Make

        - #267(3): Shellcheck

        - #328(4): Go with `golint'

        - #329(5): Go with `go tool vet'

   - New features:

        - Add `flycheck-rust-library-path' to specify library locations
          for `rust'

        - #344(6): Add `flycheck-dmd-include-path' to change the
          include path of `d-dmd'

   - Improvements:

        - `flycheck-parse-checkstyle' supports `info' level messages now

        - Correctly parse multiline error messages of `go-build' and
          `go-test'

        - `rst-sphinx' supports custom nodes without explicit writer
          support now, by using the `pseudoxml' builder.

        - Avoid warnings about missing main functions in `rust'

7.2 0.17 (Feb 1, 2014)
======================

   - #274(1): The manual was ported to Sphinx(2) and is now located at
     <http://flycheck.readthedocs.org>

   - *Breaking changes*:

        - The default `flycheck-completion-system' was changed to nil,
          i.e. the built-in `completing-read', for compliance with
          Emacs' defaults.  To restore the previous behaviour, add
          `(eval-after-load 'flycheck '(setq flycheck-completion-system
          'ido))' to your `init.el'.

        - `flycheck-count-errors' counts errors of all levels now, and
          returns an alist mapping error symbols to error counts.

   - New syntax checkers:

        - RST (ReStructuredText) using Sphinx

        - #321(3): GNU Make

7.10 0.10 (Apr 21, 2013)
========================

   - Flycheck uses `cl-lib' now.  This library is built-in as of GNU
     Emacs 24.3.  For earlier releases of GNU Emacs 24 an additional
     compatibility library will be installed from GNU ELPA.

   - New syntax checkers:

        - #112(1): POSIX Shell script using `bash'

        - #113(2): Ruby using `rubocop'

        - #108(3): Elixir

        - #122(4): Erlang

   - Removed syntax checkers:

        - #115(5): Python using Pyflakes.  Use the superior Flake8
          syntax checker

   - New features:

        - Add `flycheck-copy-messages-as-kill', mapped to `C-c ! C-w',
          to copy all error messages under point into kill ring

        - Add `flycheck-google-messages', mapped to `C-c ! /', to
          google for error messages under point.  Needs the Google
          This(6) library

        - Syntax checkers can redirect output to a temporary directory
          now using the `temporary-directory' argument symbol

   - Improvements:

        - Call option filters for `nil' values, too

        - #112(7): Improve error parsing in Bash syntax checker

        - Error navigation does not cross restrictions in narrowed
          buffers anymore

        - #99(8): Try to preserve the non-directory part of the
          buffer's file name when substituting the `source' symbol

   - Bug fixes:

        - Fix error highlighting and navigation in narrowed buffers

        - #118(9): Use a hopefully more reliable way to parse output of
          PHP CodeSniffer

********************************


                    GNU Free Documentation License
                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008


     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         <http://fsf.org/>
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    0. PREAMBLE

    The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
    Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
    to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
    for modifications made by others.

    This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
    license designed for free software.

    We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
    software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
    it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
    whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
    principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


    1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

    This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
    work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
    licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
    copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
    under copyright law.

    A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.

    A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
    the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
    subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
    directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
    part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
    any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.

    The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
    that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
    section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
    allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
    Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.

    The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
    as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
    the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

    A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the
    general public, that is suitable for revising the document
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
    for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
    to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
    or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
    An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
    of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

    Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
    or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
    HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
    transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
    include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
    proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
    processing tools are not generally available, and the
    machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.

    The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
    formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
    the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
    preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

    The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
    the Document to the public.

    A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
    of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

    The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
    states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
    License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
    implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
    no effect on the meaning of this License.

    2. VERBATIM COPYING

    You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
    to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
    other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
    technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
    copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
    compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
    number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

    You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
    you may publicly display copies.


    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

    If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
    Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
    the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
    you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
    the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
    visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
    Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
    the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
    as verbatim copying in other respects.

    If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
    pages.

    If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
    copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
    a computer-network location from which the general network-using
    public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
    a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
    If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
    when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
    that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
    Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
    edition to the public.

    It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
    Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.


    4. MODIFICATIONS

    You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
    and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
    of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
       responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
       Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
       Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
       unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
       and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
       to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
       there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
       You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
       least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
       the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
       unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
       or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
       may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
       or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

    If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
    of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
    list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
    These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

    You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
    parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
    been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
    standard.

    You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
    passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
    through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
    includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
    by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
    you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
    permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

    The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
    give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
    imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

    You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
    License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
    versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
    Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
    list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
    license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

    The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
    copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
    different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
    adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
    author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
    Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
    Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

    In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
    in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
    "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
    Entitled "Endorsements".


    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

    You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
    documents released under this License, and replace the individual
    copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
    that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
    of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
    other respects.

    You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
    distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
    copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
    License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
    document.


    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

    A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
    resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
    of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
    When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
    apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.

    If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
    the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
    covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
    electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
    Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
    aggregate.


    8. TRANSLATION

    Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
    distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
    permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
    translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
    original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
    translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
    Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
    the original English version of this License and the original versions
    of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
    the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
    or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

    If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
    its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
    title.


    9. TERMINATION

    You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
    will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
    from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
    unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
    terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
    fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
    60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
    not give you any rights to use it.


    10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

    The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
    GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
    will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
    detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
    http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

    Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
    If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
    License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
    of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
    Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
    number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
    as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
    specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
    License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
    version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
    Document.

    11. RELICENSING

    "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
    World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
    provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
    public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
    "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
    means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

    "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
    license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
    corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
    California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
    published by that same organization.

    "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
    part, as part of another Document.

    An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
    License, and if all works that were first published under this License
    somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
    in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
    (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

    The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
    under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
    provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


    ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

    To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
    the License in the document and put the following copyright and
    license notices just after the title page:

        Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
        Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
        under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
        or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
        with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
        A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
        Free Documentation License".

    If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
    replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

        with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

    If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
    combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
    situation.

    If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
    recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
    free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
    to permit their use in free software.
