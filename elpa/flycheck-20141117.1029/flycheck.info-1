1 Introduction
**************

Flycheck is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU Emacs
24, intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which is
part of GNU Emacs.

It uses various syntax checking and linting tools to automatically check
the contents of buffers while you type, and reports warnings and errors
directly in the buffer, or in an optional error list.

     for D programs on the fly.

   - flycheck-google-cpplint(5) adds a syntax checker for Google’s C++
     style checker.

   - flycheck-haskell(6) improves Haskell support in Flycheck, by
     configuring Flycheck according to the current Cabal project, and
     using Cabal sandbox packages.

   - flycheck-hdevtools(7) adds a Flycheck syntax checker for Haskell
     based on hdevtools(8).

2 Flycheck versus Flymake
*************************

This article provides information about Flycheck compares to the
_built-in_ Flymake mode.  It does not consider the improved Flymake
fork(1) or third-party extensions such as flymake-easy(2) or
flymake-cursor(3), but references them at appropriate places.

We aim for this comparison to be neutral and complete, but do not
provide any guarantee for completeness or correctness of the following
information.  Moreover, we consider Flycheck superior to Flymake in all
aspects.  As such, you may find this page biased towards Flycheck.
Please excuse this as well as any factual mistake or lack of
information.  Please suggest improvements.

2.1 Overview
============

This table intends to give an overview about the differences and
similarities between Flycheck and the default install of Flymake.  It is
not a direct comparision to third-party extensions such as flymake-easy,
flymake-cursor, or forks of Flymake.  For a more comprehensive look
compared to those extensions, please read the details in the main
article and the footnotes.

Please do _not_ only use this table to make your personal judgment, but
also read the detailed review in the following sections, at least with
regards to the features you are interested in.

-----------------------

*Flymake* is part of GNU Emacs since GNU Emacs 22.  As such,
contributions to Flymake are subject to the FSF policies on GNU
projects.  Most notably, contributors are required to assign their
copyright to the FSF by signing a contributor agreement.

*Flycheck* is not part of GNU Emacs, and is *unlikely to ever be*.
However, it is free software as well, and publicly developed on the
well-known code hosting platform Github(1).  Contributing to Flycheck
does not require a copyright assignments.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Enabling syntax checking,  Next: Syntax checkers,  Prev: Relation to Emacs,  Up: Detailed review

2.2.2 Enabling syntax checking
------------------------------

*Flymake* is not enabled automatically for supported languages.  It must
be be enabled for each mode individually and *carefully*, because it
does not deal well with unavailable syntax checker tools.  In a GUI
frame, it signals errors in GUI dialogs.  In a TTY frame, it does not
signal any error at all, but instead silently hangs.  The same occurs,
when a syntax checker tool becomes unavailable after Flymake Mode is
enabled, for instance, because the underlying tool was uninstalled.

The third-party library flymake-easy(1) provides an alternate way to
enable Flymake Mode, which gracefully handles unavailable syntax
checkers.  It does not check whether the tool still exists before a
syntax check, though, and thus does still exposes above behavior, when a
tool becomes unavailable after the mode was enabled.

*Flycheck* provides a global mode (see *note global-flycheck-mode: 15.),
which enables syntax checking in every supported language.  If a syntax
checking tool is not available, Flycheck fails gracefully, does not
enable syntax checking, and just indicates the failure in the mode line.

................................

*Flymake* supports Java, Makefiles, Perl, PHP, TeX/LaTeX and XML.
Notably, it does _not_ support Emacs Lisp.  A third-party Flymake
fork(1) supports more languages, though.  Furthermore there are many
recipes for other languages on the Flymake page(2) in the EmacsWiki, and
many extension packages for other languages in the popular ELPA archive
MELPA(3).

*Flycheck* provides support for 43 languages (see *note Supported
languages: 5.) with 72 syntax checkers, most of them contributed by the
community.  Notably, Flycheck does _not_ support Java and Makefiles.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Definition of new syntax checkers,  Prev: Built-in syntax checkers,  Up: Syntax checkers

2.2.3.2 Definition of new syntax checkers
.........................................

*Flymake* does not provide a single function to define a new syntax
checker.  Instead, one has to define an “init” function, which returns
the command, and add this function to ‘flymake-allowed-file-name-masks’.
Additionally, one has to add the error patterns to
‘flymake-err-line-patterns’.  As such, defining a syntax checker is
difficult for users who are not familiar with Emacs Lisp.
flymake-easy(1) provides an easier way to define new syntax checkers,
though.

*Flycheck* provides a single function *note flycheck-define-checker: 19.
to define a new syntax checker.  This function uses a declarative
syntax, which is easy to understand even for users unfamiliar with Emacs
Lisp.  In fact, many syntax checkers in Flycheck were contributed by the
community(2).

For example, the Perl checker in Flymake is defined as follows.

     (defun flymake-perl-init ()
       (let* ((temp-file   (flymake-init-create-temp-buffer-copy
                            'flymake-create-temp-inplace))
              (local-file  (file-relative-name
                            temp-file
                            (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))))
         (list "perl" (list "-wc " local-file))))

     (defcustom flymake-allowed-file-name-masks
       '(;; …
         ("\\.p[ml]\\'" flymake-perl-init)
         ;; …
         ))

     (defvar flymake-err-line-patterns ; regexp file-idx line-idx col-idx (optional) text-idx(optional), match-end to end of string is error text
       (append
        '(;; …
          ;; perl
          ("\\(.*\\) at \\([^ \n]+\\) line \\([0-9]+\\)[,.\n]" 2 3 nil 1)
          ;; …
          )
        ;; …
       ))

Whereas Flycheck’s definition of the same checker looks like this:

     (flycheck-define-checker perl
       "A Perl syntax checker using the Perl interpreter.

     See URL `http://www.perl.org'."
       :command ("perl" "-w" "-c" source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start (minimal-match (message))
               " at " (file-name) " line " line
               (or "." (and ", " (zero-or-more not-newline))) line-end))
       :modes (perl-mode cperl-mode))

2.2.4 Customization of syntax checkers
--------------------------------------

*Flymake* does not provide built-in means to customize syntax checkers.
Instead, when defining a new syntax checker, the user needs to declare
customization variables explicitly and explicitly check their value in
the init function.

*Flycheck* provides built-in functions to add customization variables to
syntax checkers and splice the value of these variables into the
argument list of a syntax checking tool.  Many syntax checkers in
Flycheck provide customization variables.  For instance, you can
customize the enabled warnings for C with *note flycheck-clang-warnings:
1b.  Flycheck also tries to automatically find configuration files for
syntax checkers.

* Executables of syntax checkers:: 


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Executables of syntax checkers,  Up: Customization of syntax checkers

2.2.4.1 Executables of syntax checkers
......................................

*Flymake* does not provide built-in means to change the executable of a
syntax checker.

*Flycheck* implicitly defines a variable to set the path of a syntax
checker tool for each defined syntax checker, and provides the
interactive command *note flycheck-set-checker-executable: 1d. to change
the executable used in a buffer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker selection,  Next: Error levels,  Prev: Customization of syntax checkers,  Up: Detailed review

2.2.5 Syntax checker selection
------------------------------

*Flymake* selects syntax checkers based on file name patterns in
‘flymake-allowed-file-name-masks’.  Effectively, this duplicates the
existing logic Emacs uses to choose the right major mode, but lacks its
flexibility and power.  For instance, Flymake cannot pick a syntax
checker based on the shebang of a file.

*Flycheck* uses the major mode to select a syntax checker.  This reuses
the existing sophisticated logic Emcas uses to choose and configure
major modes.  Flycheck can easily select a Python syntax checker for a
Python script without file extension, but with proper shebang, simply
because Emacs correctly chooses Python Mode for such a file.

* Custom predicates:: 
* Manual selection:: 
* Multiple syntax checkers per buffer:: 


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Custom predicates,  Next: Manual selection,  Up: Syntax checker selection

2.2.5.1 Custom predicates
.........................

*Flymake* does not allow for custom predicates to implement more complex
logic for syntax checker selection.  For instance, Flymake cannot use
different syntax checkers for buffer depending on the value of a local
variable.

However, flymake-easy(1) patches Flymake to allow for custom syntax
checkers per buffer.  This does not happen automatically though.  The
user still needs to explicitly register a syntax checker in a major mode
hook.

*Flycheck* supports custom predicate function.  It uses these to
implement the shell script syntax checkers, for instance.  Emacs uses a
single major mode for various shell script types (e.g.  Bash, Zsh, POSIX
Shell, etc.), so Flycheck additionally uses a custom predicate to look
at the value of the variable ‘sh-shell’ in Sh Mode buffers, to determine
which shell to use for syntax checking.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Manual selection,  Next: Multiple syntax checkers per buffer,  Prev: Custom predicates,  Up: Syntax checker selection

2.2.5.2 Manual selection
........................

*Flymake* does not provide means to manually select a specific syntax
checker, either interactively, or via local variables.

*Flycheck* provides the local variable *note flycheck-checker: 21. to
explicitly use a specific syntax checker for a buffer, and the command
*note flycheck-select-checker: 22. to set this variable interactively.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Multiple syntax checkers per buffer,  Prev: Manual selection,  Up: Syntax checker selection

2.2.5.3 Multiple syntax checkers per buffer
...........................................

*Flymake* can only use a single syntax checker per buffer.  Effectively,
the user can only use a single tool to check a buffer, for instance
either PHP Mess Detector or PHP CheckStyle.  Third party extensions to
Flycheck work around this limitation by supplying custom shell scripts
to call multiple syntax checking tools at once.

*Flycheck* can easily apply multiple syntax checkers per buffer.  For
instance, Flycheck will check PHP files with PHP CLI first to find
syntax errors, then with PHP MessDetector to additionally find idiomatic
and semantic errors, and eventually with PHP CheckStyle to find
stylistic errors.  The user will see all errors reported by all of these
utilities in the buffer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error levels,  Next: Error parsing,  Prev: Syntax checker selection,  Up: Detailed review

2.2.6 Error levels
------------------

*Flymake* supports error and warning messages.  The pattern of warning
messages is _hard-coded_ in Emacs 24.3, and only became customizable in
upcoming Emacs 24.4.  The patterns to parse messages are kept separate
from the actual syntax checker.

The third-party Flymake fork(1) also supports info messages, and makes
the pattern of warning messages customizable as well.

*Flycheck* supports error, warning and info messages.  The patterns to
parse messages of different levels are part of the syntax checker
definition, and thus specific to each syntax checker.  Flycheck allows
to define new error levels for use in custom syntax checkers with *note
flycheck-define-error-level: 25.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error parsing,  Next: Error message display,  Prev: Error levels,  Up: Detailed review

2.2.7 Error parsing
-------------------

*Flymake* parses the output of syntax checker tools with regular
expressions only.  As it splits the output by lines regardless of the
regular expressions, it does not support error messages spanning
multiple lines (such as returned by the Emacs Lisp byte compiler or by
the Glasgow Haskell Compiler).

flymake-easy(1) overrides internal Flymake functions to support
multiline error messages.

*Flycheck* can use regular expressions as well as custom parsing
functions.  By means of such functions, it can parse JSON, XML or other
structured output formats.  Flycheck includes some ready-to-use parsing
functions for well-known output formats, such as Checkstyle XML. By
parsing structured output format, Flycheck can handle arbitrarily
complex error messages.  Also, with regular expressions it uses the
error patterns to split the output into tokens, and thus handles
multiline messages just as well.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error message display,  Next: Error list,  Prev: Error parsing,  Up: Detailed review

2.2.8 Error message display
---------------------------

In GUI frames, *Flymake* shows error messages in a tool tip, if the user
hovers the mouse over an error location.  It does not provide means to
show error messages in a TTY frame, or with the keyboard only.

The third-party library flymake-cursor(1) shows Flymake error messages
at point in the echo area, by overriding internal Flymake functions.

*Flycheck* shows error message tool tips as well, but also displays
error messages in the echo area, if the point is at an error location.
This feature is fully customizable via *note
flycheck-display-errors-function: 28.

*Flycheck* can list all errors in the current buffer in a separate
window.  This error list is automatically updated after each syntax
check, and follows the focus.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checking,  Next: Checking for changes,  Up: Resource consumption

2.2.10.1 Syntax checking
........................

*Flymake* starts a syntax check after every change, regardless of
whether the buffer is visible in a window or not.  It does not limit the
number of concurrent syntax checks.  As such, Flymake starts many
concurrent syntax checks, if many buffers are changed at the same time
(e.g.  after a VCS revert), which is known to freeze Emacs temporarily.

The third-party Flymake fork(1) limits the number of concurrent syntax
checks.  It does not take care to check visible buffers first, though.

*Flycheck* does not conduct syntax checks in buffers which are not
visible in any window.  Instead it defers syntax checks in such buffers
until after the buffer is visible again.  Hence, Flycheck does only
start as many concurrent syntax checks as there are visible windows in
the current Emacs session.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Checking for changes,  Prev: Syntax checking,  Up: Resource consumption

2.2.10.2 Checking for changes
.............................

*Flymake* uses a _separate_ timer (in ‘flymake-timer’) to periodically
check for changes in each buffer.  These timers run even if the
corresponding buffers do not change.  This is known to cause
considerable CPU load with many open buffers.

The third-party Flymake fork(1) uses a single global timer to check for
changes.  This greatly reduces the CPU load, but still consumes some
marginal CPU, even if Emacs is idle and not in use currently.

*Flycheck* does not use timers at all to check for changes.  Instead it
registers a handler for Emacs’ built-in ‘after-change-functions’ hook,
which is run after changes to the buffer.  This handler is only invoked
when the buffer actually changed, and starts a one-shot timer to delay
the syntax check until the editing stopped for a short time, to save
resources and avoid checking half-finished editing.

3.1.1 Emacs
-----------

Flycheck supports Emacs 24 on Unix systems.  It is tested with Emacs
24.3, and Emacs snapshot builds.  It should work with GNU Emacs 24.1 and
24.2 as well, but it is not tested against these versions.  If it does
not work with these versions, please report an issue.

     Warning: Flycheck does not support Windows, but tries to be
     compatible with it.  You may try to use Flycheck on Windows.  It
     should mostly work, but expect problems and issues.  Pull requests
     which improve Windows compatibility are welcome.

     Flycheck also does not support GNU Emacs 23 and other flavors of
     Emacs (e.g.  XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.).  Don’t try, it will _not_
     work.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checking tools,  Prev: Emacs,  Up: Prerequisites

3.1.2 Syntax checking tools
---------------------------

For almost all supported languages, Flycheck also needs additional
*external* checker programs.  See *note Supported languages: 35. for a
list of supported languages and the corresponding checkers programs, and
use *note flycheck-describe-checker: 36. to get help about specific
checkers inside Emacs.

For instance, for Python you need either Flake8(1) or Pylint(2), which
can be installed with ‘pip install flake8’ and ‘pip install pylint’
respectively.

Generally you can install the required external checker programs with
the standard package manager of the corresponding programming languages
(e.g.  Rubygems for Ruby, NPM for Javascript).  Many checker programs
are also available in the package repositories of popular Linux
distributions, or as Formula for the OS X package manager Homebrew(3).

Enable Flycheck globally by adding the following to your ‘init.el’, and
restart Emacs:

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Install some syntax checker tools,  Next: Check syntax in a buffer,  Prev: Enable Flycheck,  Up: Quickstart

4.2 Install some syntax checker tools
=====================================

Install some syntax checking tools for the programming or markup
language you are using.  Take a look at the *note list of supported
languages: 5. to check what languages and tools are supported.

For Python:

     $ pip install --user pylint

Or for Ruby:

     $ gem install rubocop ruby-lint

Or for Haskell:

     $ brew install haskell-platform
     $ cabal install hlint

The *note language list: 5. also lists the available options for each
syntax checker.  Take a look at these to tune the syntax checkers to
your needs, and read *note how to use these options: 41.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Check syntax in a buffer,  Next: Navigate and list errors,  Prev: Install some syntax checker tools,  Up: Quickstart

4.3 Check syntax in a buffer
============================

Flycheck will now check syntax using these tools, when you visit a
buffer in any of these languages.  Syntax checking happens
*automatically* when you save the buffer or make any changes.  Flycheck
highlights errors and warnings in the buffer, indicates them in the
fringe, and reports their numbers in the mode line.

You can also manually check a buffer with ‘C-c ! c’ (*note
flycheck-buffer: 43.).


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Navigate and list errors,  Next: Explore the menu,  Prev: Check syntax in a buffer,  Up: Quickstart

4.4 Navigate and list errors
============================

Use ‘C-c ! n’ (*note flycheck-next-error: 45.) and ‘C-c ! p’ (*note
flycheck-previous-error: 46.) to navigate between error locations.  If
you keep the point at an error location, Flycheck will show the error
message in the echo area after a short delay.  You can also hover error
locations with the mouse and see the error message in a tooltip.

To get an overview of all errors and warnings in the current buffer,
type ‘C-c ! l’ (*note flycheck-list-errors: 47.) to pop up a list of all
errors in your current buffer.  The error list updates automatically
when you fix errors or introduce new ones, or when you switch to another
buffer.

5.1 Flycheck Mode
=================

Syntax checking is done in the Flycheck minor mode:

 -- Command: M -x flycheck-mode

     Toggle Flycheck Mode for the current buffer.

 -- User Option: flycheck -mode

     Whether Flycheck Mode is enabled in the current buffer.

 -- Command: M -x global-flycheck-mode

     Toggle Flycheck Mode for *all* live buffers, and for new buffers.

     With Global Flycheck Mode, Flycheck Mode is automatically enabled
     in all buffers, for which a *note suitable syntax checker: 50.
     exists and is enabled.

          Note: Flycheck Mode will *not* be enabled in buffers for
          remote or encrypted files.  The former is flaky and might be
          very slow, and the latter might leak confidential data to
          temporary directories.

          You can still explicitly enable Flycheck Mode in such buffers
          with *note flycheck-mode: 4e.  This is *not* recommended
          though.

 -- User Option: global -flycheck-mode

     Whether Flycheck Mode is enabled globally.

If you like Flycheck Mode, you may want to enable it permanently, either
by customizing *note global-flycheck-mode: 51, or by adding the
following code to your ‘init.el’:

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checking<2>,  Next: Syntax checker selection<2>,  Prev: Flycheck Mode,  Up: Usage

5.2 Syntax checking
===================

By default, *note Flycheck Mode: 4d. checks syntax automatically when

   - the mode is enabled,

   - the file is saved,

   - new lines are inserted,

   - or some short time after the last change to the buffer.

However, you can customize automatic syntax checking with *note
flycheck-check-syntax-automatically: 53.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -check-syntax-automatically

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘symbolp’.

     When Flycheck should check syntax automatically.

     This variable is a list of events that may trigger syntax checks.
     The following events are known:

     ‘`save'’
          Check syntax immediately after the buffer was saved.

     ‘`idle-change'’
          Check syntax a short time (see *note ‘flycheck-idle-change-delay’: 54.)
          after the last change to the buffer.

     ‘`new-line'’
          Check syntax immediately after a new line was inserted into
          the buffer.

     ‘`mode-enabled'’
          Check syntax immediately when *note ‘flycheck-mode’: 4e. is enabled.

     Flycheck performs a syntax checks only on events, which are
     contained in this list.  For instance, if the value of this
     variable is ‘(mode-enabled save)’, Flycheck will only check if
     the mode is enabled or the buffer was saved, but never after
     changes to the buffer contents.

     If nil, never check syntax automatically.  In this case, use
     *note ‘flycheck-buffer’: 43. to start a syntax check manually.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.12 of the flycheck package.

 -- User Option: flycheck -idle-change-delay

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘numberp’.

     How many seconds to wait before checking syntax automatically.

     After the buffer was changed, Flycheck will wait as many seconds
     as the value of this variable before starting a syntax check.  If
     the buffer is modified during this time, Flycheck will wait
     again.

     This variable has no effect, if ‘`idle-change'’ is not contained in
     *note ‘flycheck-check-syntax-automatically’: 53.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.13 of the flycheck package.

Regardless of automatic syntax checking you can also check the buffer
manually:

 -- Command: C -c ! c
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-buffer

     Check syntax in the current buffer.

Each syntax check conducts the following steps:

  1. Run hooks in *note flycheck-before-syntax-check-hook: 55.

  2. Clear error information from previous syntax checks.

  3. Select a *note suitable syntax checker: 50.  See *note Syntax
     checker selection: 56, for more information on how syntax checkers
     are selected.

  4. Copy the contents of the buffer to be checked to a temporary file.

  5. Run the syntax checker.

  6. Parse the output of the tool, and report all errors and warnings.
     See *note Error reporting: 7, for more information.

  7. If the buffer can be checked with another syntax checker, continue
     from step 4, but with the next syntax checker.  This is called
     *note chaining: 57. of syntax checkers.

  8. Run hooks in *note flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook: 58.

Whenever the status of Flycheck changes, Flycheck runs *note
flycheck-status-changed-functions: 59.:

 -- Hook: flycheck -status-changed-functions

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to run if the Flycheck status changed.

     This hook is run whenever the status of Flycheck changes.  Each
     hook function takes the status symbol as sinlge argument, as
     given to *note ‘flycheck-report-status’: 5a, which see.

     This variable is a abnormal hook.  See Info
     node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

     This hook was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
     version 0.20 of the flycheck package.

There are also special hooks, which run only for certain status changes:

 -- Hook: flycheck -after-syntax-check-hook

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to run after each syntax check.

     This hook is run after a syntax check was finished.

     At this point, *all* chained checkers were run, and all errors
     were parsed, highlighted and reported.  The variable
     *note ‘flycheck-current-errors’: 5b. contains all errors from all syntax
     checkers run during the syntax check, so you can apply any error
     analysis functions.

     Note that this hook does *not* run after each individual syntax
     checker in the syntax checker chain, but only after the *last
     checker*.

     This variable is a normal hook.  See Info node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

 -- Hook: flycheck -before-syntax-check-hook

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to run before each syntax check.

     This hook is run right before a syntax check starts.

     Error information from the previous syntax check is *not*
     cleared before this hook runs.

     Note that this hook does *not* run before each individual syntax
     checker in the syntax checker chain, but only before the *first
     checker*.

     This variable is a normal hook.  See Info node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

There is also a hook run whenever a syntax check fails:

 -- Hook: flycheck -syntax-check-failed-hook

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to run if a syntax check failed.

     This hook is run whenever an error occurs during Flycheck’s
     internal processing.  No information about the error is given to
     this hook.

     You should use this hook to conduct additional cleanup actions
     when Flycheck failed.

     This variable is a normal hook.  See Info node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

During syntax checks, Flycheck generates some temporary files for syntax
checker input and output.  Use *note flycheck-temp-prefix: 5d. to change
the prefix of these temporary files:

 -- User Option: flycheck -temp-prefix

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Prefix for temporary files created by Flycheck.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.19 of the flycheck package.

5.3 Syntax checker selection
============================

By default Flycheck selects a *note suitable syntax checker: 50.
automatically from *note flycheck-checkers: 5f, with respect to *note
flycheck-disabled-checkers: 60.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -checkers

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Syntax checkers available for automatic selection.

     A list of Flycheck syntax checkers to choose from when syntax
     checking a buffer.  Flycheck will automatically select a suitable
     syntax checker from this list, unless *note ‘flycheck-checker’: 21. is set,
     either directly or with *note ‘flycheck-select-checker’: 22.

     You should not need to change this variable normally.  In order
     to disable syntax checkers, please use
     *note ‘flycheck-disabled-checkers’: 60.  This variable is intended for 3rd
     party extensions to tell Flycheck about new syntax checkers.

     Syntax checkers in this list must be defined with
     *note ‘flycheck-define-checker’: 19.

     An item in this list is a *note registered syntax checker: 61.

 -- User Option: flycheck -disabled-checkers

          Variable properties: Automatically becomes buffer-local when
          set.  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its
          value satisfies the predicate *note flycheck-symbol-list-p:
          62.

     Syntax checkers excluded from automatic selection.

     A list of Flycheck syntax checkers to exclude from automatic
     selection.  Flycheck will never automatically select a syntax
     checker in this list, regardless of the value of
     *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.

     However, syntax checkers in this list are still available for
     manual selection with *note ‘flycheck-select-checker’: 22.

     Use this variable to disable syntax checkers, instead of removing
     the syntax checkers from *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.  You may also use
     this option as a file or directory local variable to disable
     specific checkers in individual files and directories
     respectively.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.16 of the flycheck package.

A syntax checker in *note flycheck-checkers: 5f. and *not* in *note
flycheck-disabled-checkers: 60. is an *note enabled syntax checker: 63.

Flycheck uses the first enabled and suitable syntax checker for the
current buffer.  See ‘Languages and syntax checkers’ for a list of all
available syntax checkers.

If no *note suitable syntax checker: 50. is found, the syntax check is
_silently_ omitted.  _No_ error is signalled.  Only a special indicator
in the mode line informs about the omitted syntax check.  See ‘Mode
line’ for details.

You can manually select a specific syntax checker for the current
buffer, too:

 -- Command: C -c ! s
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-select-checker

     Select the syntax checker for the current buffer by setting *note
     flycheck-checker: 21, and run a syntax check with the new syntax
     checker.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and set *note flycheck-checker: 21.

     Any *note syntax checker: 64. can be selected with this command,
     regardless of whether it is enabled.

 -- Command: C -u C-c ! s

 -- Command: C -u M-x flycheck-select-checker

     Deselect the current syntax checker, and run a syntax check with an
     automatically selected syntax checker.

     Set *note flycheck-checker: 21. to ‘nil’.

 -- Function: flycheck -select-checker checker

     Select CHECKER for the current buffer.

     CHECKER is a syntax checker symbol (see *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.) or
     nil.  In the former case, use CHECKER for the current buffer,
     otherwise deselect the current syntax checker (if any) and use
     automatic checker selection via *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.

     If called interactively prompt for CHECKER.  With prefix arg
     deselect the current syntax checker and enable automatic
     selection again.

     Set *note ‘flycheck-checker’: 21. to CHECKER and automatically start a new
     syntax check if the syntax checker changed.

     CHECKER will be used, even if it is not contained in
     *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f, or if it is disabled via
     *note ‘flycheck-disabled-checkers’: 60.

 -- Variable: flycheck -checker

          Variable properties: Automatically becomes buffer-local when
          set.  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its
          value satisfies the predicate *note
          flycheck-registered-checker-p: 65.

     Syntax checker to use for the current buffer.

     If unset or nil, automatically select a suitable syntax checker
     from *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f. on every syntax check.

     If set to a syntax checker only use this syntax checker and never
     select one from *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f. automatically.  The syntax
     checker is used regardless of whether it is contained in
     *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f. or *note ‘flycheck-disabled-checkers’: 60.  If the
     syntax checker is unusable in the current buffer an error is
     signaled.

     A syntax checker assigned to this variable must be defined with
     *note ‘flycheck-define-checker’: 19.

     Use the command *note ‘flycheck-select-checker’: 22. to select a syntax
     checker for the current buffer, or set this variable as file
     local variable to always use a specific syntax checker for a
     file.  See Info Node *note (emacs)Specifying File Variables:: for more
     information about file variables.

You can change the completion system used by *note
flycheck-select-checker: 22.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -completion-system

     The completion system to use.

     ‘`ido'’
          Use IDO.

          IDO is a built-in alternative completion system, without
          good flex matching and a powerful UI.  You may want to
          install flx-ido (see URL ‘https://github.com/lewang/flx’(1)) to
          improve the flex matching in IDO.

     ‘`grizzl'’
          Use Grizzl.

          Grizzl is an alternative completion system with powerful
          flex matching, but a very limited UI.  See URL
          ‘https://github.com/d11wtq/grizzl’(2).

     nil
          Use the standard unfancy ‘`completing-read'’.

          ‘`completing-read'’ has a very simple and primitive UI, and
          does not offer flex matching.  This is the default setting,
          though, to match Emacs’ defaults.  With this system, you may
          want enable option ‘`icomplete-mode'’ to improve the display
          of completion candidates at least.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.17 of the flycheck package.

Each syntax checker provides documentation with information about the
executable the syntax checker uses, in which buffers it will be used for
syntax checks, and whether it can be configured.  See ‘Configuration’,
for more information about syntax checker configuration.

 -- Command: C -c ! ?
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-describe-checker

     Show the documentation of a syntax checker.

================================

* Menu:

* Syntax checker executables:: 
* Syntax checker options:: 
* Syntax checker configuration files:: 


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker executables,  Next: Syntax checker options,  Up: Syntax checker configuration

5.4.1 Syntax checker executables
--------------------------------

For each syntax checker, there is a buffer-local, customizable variable
‘flycheck-CHECKER-executable’, where CHECKER is the name of the syntax
checker.

The value of this variable is either nil, or a string.  In the former
case, Flycheck uses the default executable from the syntax checker
definition when executing the syntax checker.  In the latter case, it
uses the value of the variable as executable.

Use these variables to override the executable from the definition per
buffer.  For instance, you could use a different Emacs version with the
‘emacs-lisp’ or ‘emacs-lisp-checkdoc’.

You can either set these variables directly in your ‘init.el’, or change
them interactively:

 -- Command: C -c ! e
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-set-checker-executable

     Set the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and an executable file, and set the
     executable variable of the syntax checker.

 -- Command: C -u C-c ! e

 -- Command: C -u M-x flycheck-set-checker-executable

     Reset the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and reset its executable to the
     default.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker options,  Next: Syntax checker configuration files,  Prev: Syntax checker executables,  Up: Syntax checker configuration

5.4.2 Syntax checker options
----------------------------

Some syntax checkers can be configured via options.  See *note Supported
languages: 35. for a complete list of options for each syntax checkers.

All options are customizable via ‘M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-options’, and automatically buffer-local to easily set them in
hooks.

Options are mainly intended to be used by *note extensions: b, and via
File or Directory Local variables.  See *note (emacs)File Variables::
and *note (emacs)Directory Variables:: respectively.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker configuration files,  Prev: Syntax checker options,  Up: Syntax checker configuration

5.4.3 Syntax checker configuration files
----------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers also read configuration files, denoted by
associated _configuration file variables_.  See *note Supported
languages: 35. of these variables.

All options are customizable via ‘M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files’, and automatically buffer-local to easily set
them in hooks.  You may also set them via File or Directory Local
variables.  See *note (emacs)File Variables:: and *note (emacs)Directory
Variables:: respectively.

When set to a string, Flycheck tries to locate the configuration file
using the functions in *note flycheck-locate-config-file-functions: 6d.
and passes the name of the file to the syntax checker:

 -- User Option: flycheck -locate-config-file-functions

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to locate syntax checker configuration files.

     Each function in this hook must accept two arguments: The value
     of the configuration file variable, and the syntax checker
     symbol.  It must return either a string with an absolute path to
     the configuration file, or nil, if it cannot locate the
     configuration file.

     The functions in this hook are called in order of appearance, until a
     function returns non-nil.  The configuration file returned by that
     function is then given to the syntax checker if it exists.

     This variable is an abnormal hook.  See Info
     node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

With the default value of this variable, configuration files are located
by the following algorithm:

  1. If the configuration file variable contains a path a directory
     separator, expand the path against the buffer’s default directory
     and use the resulting path as configuration file.

  2. If the buffer has a file name, search the buffer’s directory and
     any ancestors thereof for the configuration file.

  3. Eventually attempt to locate the configuration file in the user’s
     home directory.

If any of these steps succeeds, the subsequent steps are not executed.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error reporting,  Next: Error messages,  Prev: Syntax checker configuration,  Up: Usage

5.5 Error reporting
===================

Errors and warnings from a syntax checker are

   - reported in the mode line or in a popup buffer, depending on the
     length of the error messages,

   - indicated according to *note flycheck-indication-mode: 6f,

   - and highlighted in the buffer with the corresponding faces,
     according to *note flycheck-highlighting-mode: 70.

 -- Face: flycheck -error
 -- Face: flycheck -warning
 -- Face: flycheck -info

     The faces to use to highlight errors, warnings and info messages
     respectively.

          Note: The default faces provided by GNU Emacs are ill-suited
          to highlight errors because these are relatively pale and do
          not specify a background color or underline.  Hence highlights
          are easy to overlook and even *invisible* for white space.

     For best error highlighting customize these faces, or choose a
     color theme that has reasonable Flycheck faces.  The popular
     Solarized(1) and Zenburn(2) themes are known to have good Flycheck
     faces.

 -- User Option: flycheck -highlighting-mode

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘symbolp’.

     The highlighting mode for Flycheck errors and warnings.

     The highlighting mode controls how Flycheck highlights errors in
     buffers.  The following modes are known:

     ‘`columns'’
          Highlight the error column.  If the error does not have a column,
          highlight the whole line.

     ‘`symbols'’
          Highlight the symbol at the error column, if there is any,
          otherwise behave like ‘`columns'’.  This is the default.

     ‘`sexps'’
          Highlight the expression at the error column, if there is
          any, otherwise behave like ‘`columns'’.  Note that this mode
          can be *very* slow in some major modes.

     ‘`lines'’
          Highlight the whole line.

     nil
          Do not highlight errors at all.  However, errors will still
          be reported in the mode line and in error message popups,
          and indicated according to *note ‘flycheck-indication-mode’: 6f.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.14 of the flycheck package.

 -- Face: flycheck -fringe-error
 -- Face: flycheck -fringe-warning
 -- Face: flycheck -fringe-info

     The faces of fringe indicators for errors, warnings and info
     messages respectively.

 -- User Option: flycheck -indication-mode

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘symbolp’.

     The indication mode for Flycheck errors and warnings.

     This variable controls how Flycheck indicates errors in buffers.
     May either be ‘`left-fringe'’, ‘`right-fringe'’, or nil.

     If set to ‘`left-fringe'’ or ‘`right-fringe'’, indicate errors and
     warnings via icons in the left and right fringe respectively.

     If set to nil, do not indicate errors and warnings, but just
     highlight them according to *note ‘flycheck-highlighting-mode’: 70.

You can also completely customize error processing by hooking into
Flycheck:

 -- Hook: flycheck -process-error-functions

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to process errors.

     Each function in this hook must accept a single argument: A
     Flycheck error to process.

     All functions in this hook are called in order of appearance,
     until a function returns non-nil.  Thus, a function in this hook
     may return nil, to allow for further processing of the error, or
     any non-nil value, to indicate that the error was fully processed
     and inhibit any further processing.

     The functions are called for each newly parsed error immediately
     after the corresponding syntax checker finished.  At this stage,
     the overlays from the previous syntax checks are still present,
     and there may be further syntax checkers in the chain.

     This variable is an abnormal hook.  See Info
     node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

     See also
.............

     *note Error API: 78.

     This hook was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
     version 0.13 of the flycheck package.

If you hover a highlighted error with the mouse, a tooltip with the
top-most error message will be shown.

Ultimately, you can clear all reported errors at once:

 -- Command: C -c ! C
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-clear

     Clear all Flycheck errors and warnings in the current buffer.

     You should not normally need this command, because Flycheck checks
     the buffer periodically anyway.

Note that if a syntax checker reports too many errors, Flycheck will
discard these errors and disable the syntax checker for subsequent
syntax checks.  The threshold is customizable with *note
flycheck-checker-error-threshold: 7a.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -checker-error-threshold

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Maximum errors allowed per syntax checker.

     The value of this variable is either an integer denoting the
     maximum number of errors per syntax checker and buffer, or nil to
     not limit the errors reported from a syntax checker.

     If this variable is a number and a syntax checker reports more
     errors than the value of this variable, its errors are not
     discarded, and not highlighted in the buffer or available in the
     error list.  The affected syntax checker is also disabled for
     future syntax checks of the buffer.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.22 of the flycheck package.

5.6 Error messages
==================

Flycheck also displays error messages under point after a short delay:

 -- User Option: flycheck -display-errors-delay

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘numberp’.

     Delay in seconds before displaying errors at point.

     Use floating point numbers to express fractions of seconds.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.15 of the flycheck package.

The error is displayed via *note flycheck-display-errors-function: 28.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -display-errors-function

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Function to display error messages.

     If set to a function, call the function with the list of errors
     to display as single argument.  Each error is an instance of the
     ‘`flycheck-error'’ struct.

     If set to nil, do not display errors at all.

     See also
.............

     The flycheck-pos-tip(1) extension provides a display function to
     show errors at point in a graphical popup.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.13 of the flycheck package.

The default function displays the error messages in the echo area:

 -- Function: flycheck -display-error-messages errors

     Display the messages of ERRORS.

     Concatenate all non-nil messages of ERRORS separated by empty
     lines, and display them with ‘`display-message-or-buffer'’, which
     shows the messages either in the echo area or in a separate
     buffer, depending on the number of lines.  See Info
     node *note (elisp)Displaying Messages:: for more information.

     In the latter case, show messages in
     ‘`flycheck-error-message-buffer'’.

Alternatively, the following error display functions are available:

 -- Function: flycheck -display-error-messages-unless-error-list errors

     Show messages of ERRORS unless the error list is visible.

     Like *note ‘flycheck-display-error-messages’: 7e, but only if the error
     list (see *note ‘flycheck-list-errors’: 47.) is not visible in any window in
     the current frame.

You can also work with the error messages at point, and copy them into
the kill ring or search them on Google:

 -- Command: C -c ! C-w
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-copy-messages-as-kill

     Copy all Flycheck error messages at the current point into kill
     ring.

 -- Command: C -c ! /
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-google-messages

     Google for all Flycheck error messages at the current point.

     If there are more than *note flycheck-google-max-messages: 82.
     errors at point, signal an error, to avoid spamming your browser
     with Google tabs.

     Requires the Google This(2) library, which is available on
     MELPA(3).

      -- User Option: flycheck -google-max-messages

               Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file
               local variable if its value satisfies the predicate
               ‘numberp’.

          How many messages to google at once.

          If set to an integer, *note ‘flycheck-google-messages’: 81. will signal an
          error if there are more Flycheck messages at point than the value
          of this variable.

          If set to nil, *note ‘flycheck-google-messages’: 81. will always google *all*
          messages at point.  This setting is *not* recommended.

          This user option was introduced, or its default value was
          changed, in version 0.10 of the flycheck package.

5.7 Error list
==============

You can also show a list with all errors in the current buffer:

 -- Command: C -c ! l
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-list-errors
 -- Command: M -x list-flycheck-errors

     List all errors in the current buffer in a separate buffer.

     The error list automatically refreshes after a syntax check, and
     follows the current buffer and window, that is, if you switch to
     another buffer or window, the error list is updated to show the
     errors of the new buffer or window.

Every time the error list refreshes, *note
flycheck-error-list-after-refresh-hook: 86. is run:

 -- Hook: flycheck -error-list-after-refresh-hook

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Functions to run after the error list was refreshed.

     This hook is run whenever the error list is refreshed.

     This variable is a normal hook.  See Info node *note (elisp)Hooks::.

     This hook was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
     version 0.21 of the flycheck package.

When you move the point in the current buffer while the error list is
visible, all errors on the current line are highlighted in the error
list with *note flycheck-error-list-highlight: 87.:

 -- Face: flycheck -error-list-highlight

     Flycheck face to highlight errors in the error list.

     This face was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
     version 0.15 of the flycheck package.

You can customize the appearance of the line and column numbers and of
the syntax checker name:

 -- Face: flycheck -error-list-line-number

     Face for line numbers in the error list.

 -- Face: flycheck -error-list-column-number

     Face for line numbers in the error list.

 -- Face: flycheck -error-list-checker-name

     Face for the syntax checker name in the error list.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error navigation,  Next: Mode line,  Prev: Error list<2>,  Up: Usage

5.8 Error navigation
====================

Flycheck integrates into standard error navigation commands of Emacs.
If *no* compilation buffer (including those from ‘M-x compile’, ‘M-x
grep’, ‘M-x occur’, etc.)  is visible, ‘M-g n’ (‘next-error’) and ‘M-g
p’ (‘previous-error’) will navigate between Flycheck warnings and errors
in the current buffer.  See *note (emacs)Compilation Mode:: for more
information about these commands.

You can disable this integration by setting *note
flycheck-standard-error-navigation: 8d. to nil:

 -- User Option: flycheck -standard-error-navigation

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘booleanp’.

     Whether to support error navigation with ‘`next-error'’.

     If non-nil, enable navigation of Flycheck errors with
     ‘`next-error'’, ‘`previous-error'’ and ‘`first-error'’.  Otherwise,
     these functions just navigate errors from compilation modes.

     Flycheck error navigation with *note ‘flycheck-next-error’: 45,
     *note ‘flycheck-previous-error’: 46. and *note ‘flycheck-first-error’: 8e. is always
     enabled, regardless of the value of this variable.

     Note that this setting only takes effect when *note ‘flycheck-mode’: 4e. is
     enabled.  Changing it will not affect buffers which already have
     *note ‘flycheck-mode’: 4e. enabled.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.15 of the flycheck package.

Visible compilation buffers take precedence over Flycheck navigation.
If such a buffer is visible, ‘M-g n’ and ‘M-g p’ will ignore Flycheck
errors and warnings, and navigate errors (or generally results) reported
by the compilation buffer instead.

To address this issue, Flycheck provides independent error navigation
commands, which are not affected by *note
flycheck-standard-error-navigation: 8d.:

 -- Command: C -c ! n
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-next-error

     Jump to the next Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards by as many errors as specified
     by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 C-c ! n’ will move to the 3rd
     error from the current point.

 -- Command: C -c ! p
 -- Command: M -x flycheck-previous-error

     Jump to the previous Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump backwards by as many errors as specified
     by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 C-c ! p’ will move to the 3rd
     previous error from the current point.

 -- Command: M -x flycheck-first-error

     Jump to the first Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards to by as many errors as
     specified by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 M-x
     flycheck-first-error’ moves to the 3rd error from the beginning of
     the buffer.

These commands consider all errors by default, but you can ignore errors
below a given level with *note flycheck-navigation-minimum-level: 8f.:

 -- User Option: flycheck -navigation-minimum-level

          Variable properties: This variable is safe as a file local
          variable if its value satisfies the predicate
          ‘flycheck-error-level-p’.

     The minimum level of errors to navigate.

     If set to an error level, only navigate errors whose error level
     is at least as severe as this one.  If nil, navigate all errors.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.21 of the flycheck package.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Mode line,  Prev: Error navigation,  Up: Usage

5.9 Mode line
=============

Flycheck indicates its state in the mode line:

‘FlyC’

     There are no errors in the current buffer.

‘FlyC*’

     A syntax check is being performed currently.

‘FlyC:3/4’

     There are three errors and four warnings in the current buffer.

‘FlyC-’

     Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable syntax
     checker.  See *note Syntax checker selection: 56. for more
     information.

‘FlyC!’

     The syntax check failed.  Inspect the ‘*Messages*’ buffer for
     details.

‘FlyC?’

     The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the
     syntax checker may be flawed.  Inspect the ‘*Messages*’ buffer for
     details.

     This indicator should *never* be displayed for built-in syntax
     checkers.  If it is, please report an issue to the Flycheck
     developers, as by *note Reporting issues: 92.

Change *note flycheck-mode-line: 93. to customize the mode line
reporting:

 -- User Option: flycheck -mode-line

          Variable properties: This variable may be risky if used as a
          file-local variable.

     Mode line lighter for Flycheck.

     The value of this variable is a mode line template as in
     ‘`mode-line-format'’.  See Info Node *note (elisp)Mode Line Format:: for
     more information.  Note that it should contain a _single_ mode
     line construct only.

     Customize this variable to change how Flycheck reports its status
     in the mode line.  You may use *note ‘flycheck-mode-line-status-text’: 94.
     to obtain a human-readable status text, including an
     error/warning count.

     You may also assemble your own status text.  The current status
     of Flycheck is available in *note ‘flycheck-last-status-change’: 95.  The
     errors in the current buffer are stored in
     *note ‘flycheck-current-errors’: 5b, and the function
     *note ‘flycheck-count-errors’: 96. may be used to obtain the number of
     errors grouped by error level.

     Set this variable to nil to disable the mode line completely.

     This user option was introduced, or its default value was changed,
     in version 0.20 of the flycheck package.

               file-local variable.

          Whether to initialize packages in the Emacs Lisp syntax checker.

          To initialize packages, call ‘`package-initialize'’ before
          byte-compiling the file to check.

          When nil, never initialize packages.  When ‘`auto'’, initialize
          packages only when checking files from ‘`user-emacs-directory'’.
          For any other non-nil value, always initialize packages.

          This variable is an option for the syntax checker ‘`emacs-lisp'’

          This user option was introduced, or its default value was

               file-local variable.

          Load path to use in the Emacs Lisp syntax checker.

          When set to ‘`inherit'’, use the ‘`load-path'’ of the current Emacs
          session during syntax checking.

          When set to a list of strings, add each directory in this list to
          the ‘`load-path'’ before invoking the byte compiler.  Relative
          paths in this list are expanded against the ‘`default-directory'’
          of the buffer to check.

          When nil, do not explicitly set the ‘`load-path'’ during syntax
          checking.  The syntax check only uses the built-in ‘`load-path'’ of
          Emacs in this case.

          Note that changing this variable can lead to wrong results of the
          syntax check, e.g. if an unexpected version of a required library
          is used.

          This variable is an option for the syntax checker ‘`emacs-lisp'’

          string is a warning code to be excluded from ShellCheck reports.
          By default, no warnings are excluded.

          This variable is an option for the syntax checker ‘`sh-shellcheck'’

          This user option was introduced, or its default value was
          changed, in version 0.21 of the flycheck package.

**********

syntax checker

     A symbol which is defined as syntax checker with *note
     flycheck-define-checker: 19.

registered syntax checker

     A *note syntax checker: 64. available for automatic selection, i.e.
     that is contained in *note flycheck-checkers: 5f.

disabled syntax checker

     A *note syntax checker: 64. explicitly excluded from available
     selection, i.e.  that is contained in *note
     flycheck-disabled-checkers: 60.

enabled syntax checker

     A *note registered syntax checker: 61. which is not a *note
     disabled syntax checker: 157.

suitable syntax checker

     A *note syntax checker: 64. which can be used to check the current
     buffer.  Precisely, a syntax checker which

        - which can be used for the current major mode,

        - and whose predicate succeeds,

        - and whose syntax checker tool exists.

chaining

     In some languages, multiple *note syntax checkers: 64. can be
     applied to a buffer.  In such a case, each syntax checker specifies
     which checkers are to be used after it and when.  The result is a
     “syntax checker chain”, specifying all syntax checkers to be
     applied to the buffer.

     For instance, Haskell buffers are first checked with GHC for syntax
     and type errors, and then with ‘hlint’ for idiomatic and semantic
     mistakes.  Hence, the syntax checker chain consists of *note
     haskell-ghc: ea. and *note haskell-hlint: eb.

8.1.1.1 Breaking changes
........................

     Warning: The value of the ‘:next-checkers’ property changed in a
     backwards-incompatible way.  The custom symbols ‘no-errors’ and
     ‘warnings-only’ are gone.  Instead the first item of each cons cell
     is the _maximum permissible error level_ now.  For instance,
     ‘:next-checkers ((no-errors . foo))’ now becomes ‘:next-checkers
     ((warning . foo))’.  Please update all your syntax checker
     definitions accordingly.

The *note html-tidy: f2. syntax checker does not check Web Mode buffers
anymore, because will frequently contain strictly invalid HTML.

The *note d-dmd: c7. syntax checker requires DMD 2.066 or newer now, to
add columns to error locations.

The error list highlights all errors at the current line now.
Highlighting of errors at point, i.e.  the
‘flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point’ face and related functionality,
was removed, because it would frequently cause odd and confusing
highlighting.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Language support,  Next: Error list changes,  Prev: Breaking changes,  Up: Flycheck 0 21

8.1.1.2 Language support
........................

Flycheck now supports the Coq proof language and RPM spec files with the
new syntax checkers *note coq: c3. and *note rpm-rpmlint: 11d.
respectively.

* Menu:

* C/C++: C/C++<2>.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: C/C++<2>,  Next: D<2>,  Up: Language support

8.1.1.3 C/C++
.............

The new *note flycheck-gcc-openmp: b4. enables OpenMP for the *note
c/c++-gcc: ad. checker to suppress warnings about OpenMP pragmas.

The *note c/c++-gcc: ad. expands templates during syntax checks now.

The *note c/c++-clang: a2. syntax checker now handles empty messages
from ‘#error’ and ‘#warning’ pragmas correctly.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: D<2>,  Next: Go<2>,  Prev: C/C++<2>,  Up: Language support

8.1.1.4 D
.........

The *note d-dmd: c7. syntax checker reports columns now, making error
locations more precise.  This requires DMD 2.066.  Support for earlier
DMD versions was dropped.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Go<2>,  Next: HTML<2>,  Prev: D<2>,  Up: Language support

8.1.1.5 Go

8.1.1.6 HTML
............

*note html-tidy: f2. does not check Web Mode buffers anymore.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Less,  Next: Shell scripts,  Prev: HTML<2>,  Up: Language support

8.1.1.7 Less
............

*note less: ff. now correctly resolves relative paths in ‘data-uri’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Shell scripts,  Prev: Less,  Up: Language support

8.1.1.8 Shell scripts
.....................

The new *note flycheck-shellcheck-excluded-warnings: 142. allows to
exclude specific warnings from reports of the *note sh-shellcheck: 13e.
checker.

In a related change, *note sh-shellcheck: 13e. now includes the warning
code into all reported errors, which makes it easier to set *note
flycheck-shellcheck-excluded-warnings: 142. accordingly.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error list changes,  Next: Error navigation and display,  Prev: Language support,  Up: Flycheck 0 21

8.1.1.9 Error list changes
..........................

The error list at *note flycheck-list-errors: 47. was refined and fixed:

   - Mouse support is restored: You can now click onto error messages
     again, to navigate to the error source.

   - When navigating inside the error list with ‘n’ or ‘p’, the error
     list does not randomly alter the point position anymore.

   - The syntax checker name now appears in a separate column.  The
     appearance of this column can be customized with new face :face:
     ‘flycheck-error-list-checker-name’.

   - Errors can be sorted by syntax checker name and message now.

   - The new hook *note flycheck-error-list-after-refresh-hook: 86. now
     runs every time the error list was refreshed.

   - The error list does not highlight errors at point separately
     anymore, to avoid confusing highlighting.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error navigation and display,  Next: Syntax checker definition and extension,  Prev: Error list changes,  Up: Flycheck 0 21

8.1.1.10 Error navigation and display
.....................................

The new option *note flycheck-navigation-minimum-level: 8f. allows to
skip errors of specific error levels in error navigation, i.e.  ‘M-g n’
or ‘C-c ! n’.  Errors of levels below the value of this new option are
still shown in the buffer and in the error list, but they are skipped in
any of the navigation commands.

The new function *note
flycheck-display-error-messages-unless-error-list: 7f. shows messages of
the errors at point in the echo area, but only if the error list is
_not_ visible.  Use this function for *note
flycheck-display-errors-function: 28. to make use of this feature.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker definition and extension,  Next: Obtaining the new release,  Prev: Error navigation and display,  Up: Flycheck 0 21

8.1.1.11 Syntax checker definition and extension
................................................

The ‘:next-checkers’ property requires a maximum permissible error level
now.  The custom predicates ‘no-errors’ and ‘warnings-only’ are gone.

Syntax checker definitions can use the new ‘null-device’ symbol to add
the name of the system null device (e.g.  ‘/dev/null’ on Unix, ‘NUL’ on
Windows) to the syntax checker arguments.  Typically, this would be used
to ignore files generated by the syntax checker.  See the definition of
the *note c/c++-gcc: ad. syntax checker for an example.

The new function *note flycheck-add-mode: 169. adds major modes to
existing syntax checkers, by extending the ‘:modes’ property.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Obtaining the new release,  Prev: Syntax checker definition and extension,  Up: Flycheck 0 21

8.1.1.12 Obtaining the new release
..................................

Follow the *note installation instructions: 2f.  If you already have
Flycheck installed, just update it from ‘M-x list-packages’.

8.1.2 Flycheck 0.20
-------------------


date: Aug 12, 2014


version: 0.20

Flycheck 0.20 is out, with new syntax checkers, many new options,
improvements and bug fixes, and some important breaking changes.

This announcement covers the most important changes.  For details,
please refer to the *note Changelog: 15d.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Breaking changes<2>,  Next: Language support<2>,  Up: Flycheck 0 20

8.1.2.1 Breaking changes
........................

     Warning: The internals of syntax checker definitions changed in a
     backwards-incompatible way.  Due to the way macros work in Emacs
     Lisp *all packages depending on Flycheck* must be recompiled after
     upgrading to Flycheck 0.20!

Furthermore, the special meaning of a trailing equals sign in ‘(config
…)’ and ‘(config-file …)’ is removed.  Syntax checker definitions now
need to explicitly specify a function to concatenate the option and its
arguments.  ‘(option "--foo=" foo)’ now becomes ‘(option "--foo=" foo
concat)’.

As a consequence of this change, the position of the ‘filter’ in
‘(option …)’ changed.  The ‘filter’ is now in the *forth* element.
Hence, ‘(option "--foo" foo flycheck-option-int)’ now becomes ‘(option
"--foo" foo nil flycheck-option-int)’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Language support<2>,  Next: Error list improvements,  Prev: Breaking changes<2>,  Up: Flycheck 0 20

8.1.2.2 Language support
........................

Flycheck now supports Ada and Fortran with *note ada-gnat: 9a. and *note
fortran-gfortran: d8. respectively.

* Menu:

* C/C++: C/C++<3>. 
* Rust: Rust<2>. 
* Scala: Scala<2>. 
* Sass/SCSS:: 
* Javascript: Javascript<2>. 
* Ruby: Ruby<2>. 


File: flycheck.info,  Node: C/C++<3>,  Next: Rust<2>,  Up: Language support<2>

8.1.2.3 C/C++
.............

C/C++ can now be checked with GCC (*note c/c++-gcc: ad.) as an
alternative to Clang.  GCC supports the same options as Clang, with the
exception of *note flycheck-clang-blocks: a4.

The Clang syntax checker now supports the Clang block syntax with the
new option *note flycheck-clang-blocks: a4, and allows to disable
exceptions with *note flycheck-clang-no-exceptions: aa.

Furthermore, temporary files for the Clang syntax checker are now
created in the system temporary directory.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Rust<2>,  Next: Scala<2>,  Prev: C/C++<3>,  Up: Language support<2>

8.1.2.4 Rust
............

Support for Rust creates is greatly improved.  You can now specify the
type of crate to check with ‘flycheck-rust-crate-type’, and the root
file of the crate with ‘flycheck-rust-crate-root’.  The former avoids
redundant warnings due to unused code, and the latter helps to resolve
relative module references.

Flycheck also parses info messages from Rust now.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Scala<2>,  Next: Sass/SCSS,  Prev: Rust<2>,  Up: Language support<2>

8.1.2.5 Scala
.............

Flycheck now supports Scalastyle(1) with *note scala-scalastyle: 136.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Sass/SCSS,  Next: Javascript<2>,  Prev: Scala<2>,  Up: Language support<2>

8.1.2.6 Sass/SCSS
.................

*note sass: 132. and *note scss: 13a. now use a temporary directory for
their cache and do not clutter the source directory anymore.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Javascript<2>,  Next: Ruby<2>,  Prev: Sass/SCSS,  Up: Language support<2>

8.1.2.7 Javascript
..................

*note flycheck-eslintrc: f9. is now ‘nil’ by default.  ESLint(1) will
now find its configuration file by itself, which enables configuration
cascading.  See Configuring ESLint(2) for more information.

flycheck-rubylintrc: 127.  This requires ruby-lint 2.0.2 or newer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error list improvements,  Next: User interface improvements,  Prev: Language support<2>,  Up: Flycheck 0 20

8.1.2.9 Error list improvements
...............................

The error list (*note flycheck-list-errors: 47.) got a bunch of
improvements:

   - Errors can now be sorted by error level and by error location,
     either by clicking on the headers of ‘line’ and ‘level’
     respectively, or by pressing ‘S’ when the point is on the text of
     the corresponding column.

   - Pressing ‘RET’ on any error in the error list now jumps immediately
     to the error location.

   - ‘n’ and ‘p’ now move by errors instead by lines, even with
     multi-line error messages, and display the error location in
     another window while navigating.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: User interface improvements,  Next: Miscellaneous new features,  Prev: Error list improvements,  Up: Flycheck 0 20

8.1.2.10 User interface improvements
....................................

The mode line indicator of Flycheck is now customizable with *note
flycheck-mode-line: 93, which is a mode line template (see *note
(elisp)Mode Line Format::).  The mode line of the error list buffer is
customizable as well, with ‘flycheck-error-list-mode-line’.

The Flycheck menu at _Tools -> Syntax Checking_ was improved.  It now
provides an item to toggle Flycheck Mode in the current buffer.  Items
that are not available currently are now disabled.  The menu is also
shown on the mode line indicator now.

‘flycheck-compile’ now prompts for a syntax checker to use, defaulting
to the last used for the current buffer.

When Flycheck asks for a syntax checker in the minibuffer, it now
presents a reasonable default.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Miscellaneous new features,  Next: Miscellaneous fixes,  Prev: User interface improvements,  Up: Flycheck 0 20

8.1.2.11 Miscellaneous new features
...................................

The new hook *note flycheck-status-changed-functions: 59. lets
extensions and customization react on any status change in Flycheck.

Error levels defined with ‘flycheck-define-error-level’ can now have a
numeric severity used for sorting, with ‘:severity’.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: New features,  Next: Bug fixes,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Flycheck 0 19

8.1.3.8 New features
....................

Syntax checkers may now use the ‘:error-filter’ argument to *note
flycheck-define-checker: 19. to apply a function to all errors after
parsing.  The function is given the list of parsed errors, and shall
return the list of errors that Flycheck is to use as the result of the
syntax checker.  It may modify the list and all error objects therein
in-place.

The new option ‘flycheck-keymap-prefix’ lets you change the prefix key
used by Flycheck.  The default is still ‘C-c !’.

     Warning: The Flycheck manual assumes that you are using the default
     prefix key.  You are encouraged to leave the prefix key unchanged,
     and instead add your own custom bindings to the Flycheck key map:

          (eval-after-load 'flycheck
            '(define-key flycheck-mode-map (kbd "<f8>") #'flycheck-list-errors))

Likewise, you now can configure the prefix of in-place temporary files
created by Flycheck with *note flycheck-temp-prefix: 5d.

Flycheck now correctly kills running process and removes the temporary
files when stopping a syntax check or killing the buffer.

Also, Flycheck does not long warn if a syntax checker only reports
errors for other files.

8.1.4 Flycheck 0.18
-------------------


date: Mar 24, 2014


version: 0.18

Today, we release Flycheck 0.18.

It’s quite some time since the last release, but there are not many big
changes, as Flycheck becomes more and more mature, and slowly approaches
a 1.0 release.

* Syntax checkers: Syntax checkers<2>.

8.1.4.1 Breaking changes
........................

There are some small breaking changes.  Most notably, the naming
conventions of various shell script syntax checkers were changed.  All
of them now use the prefix ‘sh-’, and the former ‘sh-’ checkers now have
the prefix ‘sh-posix-’.  This affects their executable variables as
well.

Furthermore, the version requirements for some syntax checker tools
changed:

   - *note rust: 12b. needs upcoming Rust 0.10 now, because Flycheck
     followed backwards-incompatible upstream changes in the ‘rustc’
     options.

   - *note rst-sphinx: 120. needs Sphinx 1.2 now, because Flycheck uses
     a special writer now, which is not present in previous releases.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checkers<2>,  Next: Bug fixes<2>,  Prev: Breaking changes<4>,  Up: Flycheck 0 18

8.1.4.2 Syntax checkers
.......................

Flycheck can now check BSD Makefile with BSD Make as well.  The *note
make: 103. syntax checker does not use GNU Make specific options
anymore, and will work with any POSIX compatible variant of Make.

Go syntax checking got a major update with new syntax checkers based on
Golint(1) (*note go-golint: df.) and ‘go tool vet’ (*note go-vet: e0.).
Go now has one of the most complete and powerful syntax checker chains
in Flycheck.

Support for Perl and for shell scripts was greatly improved by
introducing two new syntax checkers:

   - *note perl-perlcritic: 107. checks Perl with the powerful
     Perl-Critic(2) tool.

   - *note sh-shellcheck: 13e. checks Shell scripts with the awesome
     Shellcheck(3) tool, which finds all sorts of idiomatic and
     semantics mistakes in shell scripts of various shell languages, and
     will greatly improve your shell scripting.

D users can now tell *note d-dmd: c7. about include directories with the
new option *note flycheck-dmd-include-path: c8.  Likewise, Rust users
can use *note flycheck-rust-library-path: 12f. now.

8.1.4.3 Bug fixes
.................

As always, a good deal of bugs and issues was fixed:

   - *note puppet-lint: 111. includes the name of the corresponding
     check in the error message now.

   - *note rst: 11f. handles ‘.. include::’ directives with relative
     file names now.

   - *note rst-sphinx: 120. will no longer choke if the document being
     checked contains custom nodes without ‘text’ writers.

   - *note rust: 12b. will not longer emit pointless warnings about
     missing ‘main’ functions in library creates.

   - Various error parsing problems were corrected in *note c/c++-clang:
     a2, *note go-build: e1. and *note go-test: e2.

8.1.5 Flycheck 0.17
-------------------


date: Feb 1, 2014


version: 0.17

Flycheck 0.17 was released today.  Though it’s just about two weeks
since the last release, there are quite some changes.

* Breaking changes: Breaking changes<5>. 
* New online manual:: 
* Syntax checkers: Syntax checkers<3>. 
* Extending syntax checkers::

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Breaking changes<5>,  Next: New online manual,  Up: Flycheck 0 17

8.1.5.1 Breaking changes
........................

The default value of *note flycheck-completion-system: 66. was changed
to ‘nil’, i.e.  Flycheck now uses plain ‘completing-read’ as default
completion system.  To restore the previous default (i.e.  IDO),
customize it with ‘M-x customize-variable RET
flycheck-completion-system’ or add the following to your ‘init.el’:

     (eval-after-load 'flycheck '(setq flycheck-completion-system 'ido))

Also, *note flycheck-count-errors: 96. was changed to count errors of
all levels.  It returns an alist mapping error levels to the amount of
errors of that level.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: New online manual,  Next: Syntax checkers<3>,  Prev: Breaking changes<5>,  Up: Flycheck 0 17

8.1.5.2 New online manual
.........................

The most notable change is the new online documentation at
‘http://flycheck.readthedocs.org’, which replaces the old online manual
at ‘http://flycheck.github.io’.  The latter now redirects to the former.

The new manual is written with Sphinx(1) instead of Texinfo(2).  The
underlying markup is ReStructuredText(3), which is simpler, less
cluttered, and more powerful than the TeX dialect of Texinfo(4).  It is
also more popular, as nowadays Sphinx has become a standard tool among
Python developers, and is also increasingly used with other languages as
well.  For instance, the LLVM documentation(5) is written in Sphinx.

Besides providing a better HTML documentation, we hope that the new
manual lowers the barrier to external contributors and increases the
amount of contributions to the documentation.

The documentation is now automatically re-build after each push to the
Github repository, so that ‘http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest’
now always hosts the up to date documentation.  Besides, there are
separate sites for each versioned release of Flycheck.  For instance,
‘http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/0.17’ now hosts the documentation of
Flycheck 0.17 now.

Beyond the manual itself, the new documentation now also includes the
release notes, which were previously hosted at
‘http://www.lunaryorn.com’, and the *note comparison with Flymake: d,
which was previously hosted at the Github Wiki of Flycheck.  The Github
Wiki is disabled now, to make all documentation available from a single
place.

Unfortunately, the Info manual included in the Flycheck ELPA packages is
somewhat inferior now, because there is some idiomatic gap between
Sphinx and Texinfo.  It’s still usable, though, and we hope to overcome
the most striking shortcomings over the time.

8.1.5.3 Syntax checkers
.......................

Flycheck can now check GNU Makefiles (see [GH-321](1)) with the new
‘make-gmake’ syntax checker.

The *note rust: 12b. syntax checker now uses ‘--no-trans’ to check for
more than just syntax errors.  For instance, it will report unused
variables now.

As part of the transition to the new manual, Flycheck now provides a
syntax checker for Sphinx documents (*note rst-sphinx: 120.).  The *note
rst: 11f. syntax checker does not check documents within a Sphinx
project anymore, do avoid false positives from Sphinx-specific markup.

........................................

   - Flycheck does not longer attach syntax checker processes to the
     buffer anymore, improving compatibility with Tabbar Mode
     ([GH-298](1)).

   - The *note emacs-lisp: cd. and *note emacs-lisp-checkdoc: ce. syntax
     checkers do not visit the file being checked anymore, to avoid
     unintended side effects from unsafe local variables, etc.
     ([GH-319](2))

   - When a buffer changes while being checked, Flycheck immediately
     re-checks the buffer after the check finished, to avoid outdated
     errors ([GH-301](3)).

8.1.6 Flycheck 0.16
-------------------


date: Jan 12, 2014


version: 0.16

Time for a new release of Flycheck, the modern syntax-checking extension
for Emacs:

In two months since the last release, Flycheck got a bunch of new syntax
checkers, a brand-new error list, and the ability to override the
executables of syntax checkers.

Let’s go through the list of important changes.  For a detailed list,
please read the *note Changelog: 15d.

8.1.6.1 Breaking changes
........................

   - The Hdevtools syntax checker was removed from Flycheck into a
     separate package flycheck-hdevtools(1) due to various issues
     ([GH-275](2)).

   - Support for coffeelint 0.x is dropped.

8.1.6.3 New languages and checkers
..................................

Flycheck supports _eight_ new languages: AsciiDoc(1), Cfengine(2),
Chef(3) recipes, ERuby(4), Handlebars(5), Racket(6), Texinfo(7), and
Verilog(8).  Additionally, there are a new syntax checker for Javascript
(eslint(9)), Ruby (ruby-lint(10)), and YAML (js-yaml(11)).

8.1.6.4 Better Haskell support
..............................

Despite the aforementioned removal of Hdevtools, Haskell support made a
leap forward.  The GHC syntax checker resolves local imports properly
now, and has new options to change the search path and the package
databases.

The brand-new flycheck-haskell(1) extension makes use of these variables
to configure the syntax checker properly in Cabal projects.  The
extensions adds all source directories of a Cabal project to the GHC
search path, and enables the package database of the project’s Cabal
sandbox.

   - The SASS and SCSS syntax checkers support the Compass framework
     now, via *note flycheck-sass-compass: 133. and *note
     flycheck-scss-compass: 13b. respectively.

   - Clang can enable Microsoft C/C++ extensions now, via *note
     flycheck-clang-ms-extensions: a9.

   - Rubocop can inhibit all style hints via the new *note
     flycheck-rubocop-lint-only: 125.

8.1.6.8 Disable syntax checkers easily
......................................

Flycheck as a new customization options *note
flycheck-disabled-checkers: 60, to easily disable syntax checkers.

Previously, you needed to remove syntax checkers from *note
flycheck-checkers: 5f. to disable them, either via the Customization
interface, or by custom Emacs Lisp:

     (setq flycheck-checkers (delq 'emacs-lisp-checkdoc flycheck-checkers))

With the new variable, there is no need for this convoluted code
anymore.  Instead, just set the variable:

     (setq flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc))

Even better, you can easily use this variable in file or directory
variables.  For instance, you can use ‘M-x add-file-local-variable RET
flycheck-disabled-checkers RET (emacs-lisp-checkdoc)’ in your ‘init.el’
to disable Checkdoc warnings while editing your ‘init.el’.

8.1.6.9 Improved error list
...........................

This release continues the improvements to the error list started in the
last release.  The error list is now based on Tabulated List Mode (see
[GH-230](1)), to address a number of issues in the old Compile
Mode-based error list (e.g.  misleading commands and menu items such as
“Recompile”).

The new error list, which you can see in the screenshot above, fixes
these issues, and has an improved visual appearance.  The columns are
aligned now, and the superfluous file name is omitted.

8.1.7 Flycheck 0.15
-------------------


date: Nov 15, 2013


version: 0.15

I have the honour and pleasure to announce a new release of Flycheck,
the modern syntax-checking extension for Emacs.

It is three months since the last release, so this release brings quite
a lot of changes.  For a complete list of all changes, please read the
complete list of *note Changelog: 15d.  This article will just cover the
most important changes.

* Menu:

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Breaking changes<7>,  Next: New syntax checkers,  Up: Flycheck 0 15

8.1.7.1 Breaking changes
........................

This release introduces three breaking changes.  Two of these are
related to the *note new-error-list: 1ab.:

     Warning: ‘flycheck-display-errors-in-list’ is gone.  If you had
     previously set *note flycheck-display-errors-function: 28. to this
     function, *remove* this setting from your configuration.

Besides, ‘flycheck-list-errors’ does not take a prefix argument anymore.
It cannot list errors at point any longer.

The third breaking change is the removal of ‘flycheck-declare-checker’,
which was obsolete already since the last release.  Unless you have
custom syntax checkers not yet ported to *note flycheck-define-checker:
19, this won’t affect you in any way.  I am not aware of any 3rd party
extension which still uses ‘flycheck-declare-checker’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: New syntax checkers,  Next: New error list,  Prev: Breaking changes<7>,  Up: Flycheck 0 15

8.1.7.2 New syntax checkers
...........................

Two new languages made it into this release: YAML (using the YAML parser
from the Ruby standard library) and Slim(1).

Additionally there are new syntax checkers for Javascript and PHP.
Flycheck can check Javascript with Google’s Closure Linter(2), in place
of Jshint.  For PHP, Flycheck now uses the PHP Mess Detector(3) to check
for semantic errors, in _addition_ to a syntax checks with PHP CLI and a
style checks with PHP CodeSniffer.

8.1.7.3 New error list
......................

The error list at ‘C-c ! l’ has been redesigned.

It is no longer a static list filled once by ‘C-c ! l’.  Instead, it
automatically updates after each syntax check, and follows the current
window, i.e.  if you switch to another window, the error list is updated
to show the errors of the corresponding buffer.

Furthermore, the error list highlights the errors at point and at the
current line.  If you move the point to an error location, the error
list automatically scrolls to the corresponding error, and highlights it
with the new ‘flycheck-error-list-highlight-at-point’ face.
Additionally, it highlights all other errors at the current line with
the new *note flycheck-error-list-highlight: 87. face.

8.1.7.4 C/C++ support
.....................

The *note c/c++-clang: a2. syntax checker for C and C++ got a bunch of
new options:

   - Set additional preprocessor definitions for syntax checking with
     *note flycheck-clang-definitions: a5, corresponding to the ‘-D’
     option for ‘clang’.

   - Include additional headers or files during syntax checking with
     *note flycheck-clang-includes: a7, corresponding to the ‘-include’
     option for ‘clang’.

   - Choose the language standard, e.g.  C++98 or C++11, with *note
     flycheck-clang-language-standard: a8, corresponding to the ‘-std’
     option for ‘clang’.

   - Disable RTTI during syntax checking with *note
     flycheck-clang-no-rtti: ab, corresponding to the ‘-fno-rtti’ option
     for ‘clang’.  In current Clang versions, however, this does not
     cause errors or warnings when using RTTI.

   - Choose the standard library for syntax checking with *note
     flycheck-clang-standard-library: ac, corresponding to the ‘-stdlib’
     option for ‘clang’.  Currently, Clang supports ‘libstdc++’ for the
     good old GNU standard library, and ‘libc++’ for the modern Libc++
     from the LLVM project.

Besides, the Clang syntax checker was changed to correctly handle local
include files, e.g.  ‘#include "foo.h"’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: New info level messages,  Next: Custom error levels,  Prev: C/C++ support,  Up: Flycheck 0 15

8.1.7.5 New ‘info’ level messages
.................................

In addition to the ‘warning’ and ‘error’ levels, Flycheck now has a new
‘info’ level, which is intended for informational messages which provide
additional information about a specific location in the source code.
With this new level, the semantics of error levels is as follows:

‘error’

     Definite errors which must be fixed for the source code to work
     correctly

‘warning’

     Potential errors and issues, which can be ignored, but still
     deserve to be fixed

‘info’

     Additional information about a specific source code location, which
     does not indicate an error or issue, but is still worth noting

Some syntax checkers were changed to use this new level for messages,
which do not really fit into the ‘warning’ level:

   - *note c/c++-clang: a2. for ‘note:’ messages

   - *note python-flake8: 113. for PEP8 naming issues emitted by the
     ‘pep8-naming’ plugin

   - *note python-pylint: 117. for convention level messages, e.g.
     naming issues, etc.

The new level is already supported by the popular Solarized(1) and
Zenburn(2) themes.

8.1.7.6 Custom error levels
...........................

The new ‘info’ level is backed by a generic mechanism to define new
error levels, using the new function *note flycheck-define-error-level:
25.  For instance, the ‘warning’ level is now defined as follows:

     (flycheck-define-error-level 'warning
       :overlay-category 'flycheck-warning-overlay
       :fringe-bitmap 'question-mark
       :fringe-face 'flycheck-fringe-warning)

A error level consists of a category for overlays, which defines the
appearance and priority of overlays for this level, and bitmap and face
for fringe indicators.

After defining an error level, you can use it the error patterns of a
syntax checker as usual.

8.1.7.7 Other improvements
..........................

Beside these important changes, there are also a number of smaller
improvements:

   - Flycheck does not longer check encrypted files for obvious reasons.

   - The *note emacs-lisp-checkdoc: ce. syntax checker does not check
     ‘.dir-locals.el’ anymore.

   - *note python-pylint: 117. now parses error columns from the output
     of ‘pylint’.

   - Spurious “flawed definition” warnings in *note lua: 101, *note rst:
     11f. and *note go-build: e1. were fixed.

   - *note c/c++-cppcheck: a3. output now parses correctly when using
     the pure Emacs Lisp XML parser in ‘xml.el’.

          Note: Nonetheless, you are advised to use Emacs with ‘libxml’
          support.  Most Linux distributions ship Emacs packages with
          ‘libxml’ support, but if you are building your own, or use a
          source-based distribution such as Gentoo, take care to enable
          ‘libxml’ for Emacs.

     ‘http://flycheck.readthedocs.org’ [GH-274](2)

   - *Breaking changes*:

        - The default ‘flycheck-completion-system’ was changed to nil,
          i.e.  the built-in ‘completing-read’, for compliance with
          Emacs’ defaults.  To restore the previous behaviour, add
          ‘(eval-after-load 'flycheck '(setq flycheck-completion-system
          'ido))’ to your ‘init.el’.

        - ‘flycheck-count-errors’ counts errors of all levels now, and

   - New syntax checkers:

        - RST (ReStructuredText) using Sphinx

        - GNU Make [GH-321](3)

   - New features:

          syntax check [GH-301](5)

        - Do not defer syntax checker after idle change timeout
          [GH-305](6)

        - Do not use the generic ‘rst’ syntax checker in Sphinx projects
          anymore, to avoid false positives by Sphinx-only markup

        - Check for more than just syntax errors in ‘rust’ [GH-314](7)

        - ‘chef-foodcritic’ supports ‘enh-ruby-mode’ now

   - Bug fixes

        - Do not attach syntax checker processes to the buffer anymore
          [GH-298](8)

8.2.14 0.10 (Apr 21, 2013)
--------------------------

   - Flycheck uses ‘cl-lib’ now.  This library is built-in as of GNU

9 Extending Flycheck
********************

This chapter explains how to add new syntax checkers to Flycheck, and
provides examples for common use cases.

If you define a new syntax checker, _please_ contribute it to Flycheck
to make it available to other users, too.  See *note Contributing syntax
checkers: 1d6. for more information.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Defining new syntax checkers,  Next: Registering new syntax checkers,  Up: Extending Flycheck

9.1 Defining new syntax checkers
================================

You define new syntax checkers with *note flycheck-define-checker: 19.:

 -- Macro: flycheck -define-checker symbol docstring &rest properties

     Define SYMBOL as syntax checker with DOCSTRING and PROPERTIES.

     DOCSTRING provides documentation for the new syntax checker.  Use
     *note ‘flycheck-describe-checker’: 36. to view the documentation of a syntax
     checker.

     The following PROPERTIES constitute a syntax checker.  ‘`:command'’
     is mandatory.  A syntax checker must also have either ‘`:modes'’ or
     ‘`:predicate'’, and either ‘`:error-patterns'’ or ‘`:error-parser'’.
     ‘`:next-checkers'’ is entirely optional.

     Signal an error at macro-expansion time if a mandatory property
     is missing or if any property as an invalid value.

     Any syntax checker defined with this macro is eligible for manual
     syntax checker selection with *note ‘flycheck-select-checker’: 22.  To make
     the new syntax checker available for automatic selection, it must
     be registered in *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.

     ‘:command (EXECUTABLE ARG ...)’
          An unquoted list describing the syntax checker command to
          execute.

          EXECUTABLE must be a string with the executable of this
          syntax checker.

          A variable ‘`flycheck-CHECKER-executable'’ is implicitly
          defined to allow overriding of the executable.  The variable
          is customizable and buffer-local.  If this variable is
          non-nil, Flycheck uses the value of the variable as
          executable, otherwise it falls back to EXECUTABLE.  In
          either case, the executable is checked with
          ‘`executable-find'’ before use.

          Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
          or as special symbol or form for
          *note ‘flycheck-substitute-argument’: 1d8, which see.

     ‘:error-patterns ((LEVEL SEXP ...) ...)’
          An unquoted list of error patterns to parse the output of
          the syntax checker ‘`:command'’.

          LEVEL is either ‘`error'’ or ‘`warning'’ and denotes the
          severity of errors matched by the pattern.  The LEVEL is
          followed by one or more RX ‘`SEXP'’s which parse the error and
          extract line, column, file name and error message.

          See ‘`rx'’ for general information about RX, and
          *note ‘flycheck-rx-to-string’: 1d9. for special RX forms provided by
          Flycheck.

          All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
          whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
          by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
          other words, the first pattern wins.

     ‘:error-parser FUNCTION’
     ‘:error-parser (lambda (output checker buffer) BODY ...)’
          A function to parse errors with, either as unquoted symbol,
          or ‘`lambda'’ form.

          The function must accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
          BUFFER, where OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
          CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
          buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
          must return a list of ‘`flycheck-error'’ objects parsed from
          OUTPUT.

     ‘:error-filter FUNCTION’
     ‘:error-filter (lambda (errors) BODY ...)’
          A function to filter or modify errors parsed by
          ‘`:error-parser'’ or ‘`:error-patterns'’.

          The function takes the list of parsed ‘`flycheck-error'’
          objects as sole argument and shall return a list of
          ‘`flycheck-error'’ as the result of the syntax checker.  The
          function is free to add or remove errors, or modify
          individual errors.  It may modify the list of errors as well
          as individual errors in place.

          Syntax checkers will mostly use this feature to fix
          misplaced error locations, or improve error messages.

     ‘:modes MODE’
     ‘:modes (MODE ...)’
          An unquoted major mode symbol or a list thereof.  If
          present, the syntax checker is only used if the major mode
          of the buffer to check is equal (as in ‘`eq'’) to any given
          MODE.

          If a ‘`:predicate'’ is present, it is additionally used in
          each buffer of these MODEs.

     ‘:predicate FUNCTION’
     ‘:predicate (lambda () BODY ...)’
          A function to determine whether to use the syntax checker in
          the current buffer, either as unquoted function symbol or
          ‘`lambda'’ form.  The syntax checker is only used if this
          function returns non-nil when called in the buffer to check.
          If ‘`:modes'’ is given, the function is only called in
          matching modes.

     ‘:next-checkers (ITEM ...)’
          An unquoted list defining the syntax checker to run after
          this syntax checker.

          Each ITEM is a cons cell ‘(LEVEL . CHECKER)’.  CHECKER is a
          syntax checker to run after this syntax checker.  LEVEL is
          an error level.  CHECKER will only be used if there are no
          current errors of at least LEVEL.  LEVEL may also be t, in
          which case CHECKER is used regardless of the current errors.

          ITEM may also be a syntax checker symbol, which is
          equivalent to ‘(t . ITEM)’.

          Flycheck tries all items in order of declaration, and uses
          the first whose LEVEL matches and whose CHECKER is
          registered and can be used for the current buffer.

 -- Macro: flycheck -def-config-file-var symbol checker &optional
          file-name &rest custom-args

     Define SYMBOL as config file variable for CHECKER, with default FILE-NAME.

     SYMBOL is declared as customizable, buffer-local variable using
     ‘`defcustom'’, to provide a configuration file for the given syntax
     CHECKER.  CUSTOM-ARGS are forwarded to ‘`defcustom'’.

     FILE-NAME is the initial value of the new variable.  If omitted,
     the default value is nil.

     Use this together with the ‘`config-file'’ form in the ‘`:command'’
     argument to *note ‘flycheck-define-checker’: 19.

 -- Macro: flycheck -def-option-var symbol init-value checker docstring
          &rest custom-args

     Define SYMBOL as option variable with INIT-VALUE for CHECKER.

     SYMBOL is declared as customizable variable, buffer-local
     variable using ‘`defcustom'’, to provide an option for the given
     syntax CHECKER.  INIT-VALUE is the initial value of the variable,
     and DOCSTRING is its docstring.  CUSTOM-ARGS are forwarded to
     ‘`defcustom'’.

     Use this together with the ‘`option'’, ‘`option-list'’ and
     ‘`option-flag'’ forms in the ‘`:command'’ argument to
     *note ‘flycheck-define-checker’: 19.

9.2 Registering new syntax checkers
===================================

After a syntax checker was defined, it should be registered for
automatic selection, by adding it to *note flycheck-checkers: 5f, e.g.

     (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'my-new-syntax-checker)

     Note: *note flycheck-checker: 21. and *note
     flycheck-select-checker: 22. are reserved for *user customization*.
     Do *not* use them in Flycheck extensions.

     Specifically, please do *not* provide a hook function which selects
     the syntax checker explicitly by assigning to *note
     flycheck-checker: 21. or by calling *note flycheck-select-checker:
     22, e.g.

          (defun enable-my-new-syntax-checker ()
            (setq flycheck-checker 'my-new-syntax-checker)
            (flycheck-buffer))

          (add-hook 'my-major-mode-hook #'enable-my-new-syntax-checker)

     This circumvents the entire automatic selection of Flycheck, and
     prevents the user from effectively customizing Flycheck.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error levels<2>,  Next: Error parsers,  Prev: Registering new syntax checkers,  Up: Extending Flycheck

9.3 Error levels
================

Flycheck provides some built-in error levels:

‘error’

     Severe errors which cannot be ignored

‘warning’

     Potential errors which can be ignored

‘info’

     Informational annotations

You can define new error levels with *note flycheck-define-error-level:
25.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Error parsers,  Next: Extending syntax checkers<2>,  Prev: Error levels<2>,  Up: Extending Flycheck

9.4 Error parsers
=================

Syntax checkers may use more sophisticated error parsing by given the
‘:error-parser’ argument to *note flycheck-define-checker: 19.  See
*note Builtin error parsers: 1e2. for a list of builtin parsers.

You may also define your own error parsers.  An error parser is any
function that takes the following three arguments and returns a list of
*note flycheck-error: 1e3. objects (see *note Error API: 78. for more
information):

‘output’

     The complete output of the syntax checker as string.

‘checker’

     A symbol denoting the executed syntax checker.

‘buffer’

     A buffer object referring to the buffer that was syntax-checked.

Flycheck provides some utility functions to implement your own error
parsers.  See *note Error parser API: 1e4. for details.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Extending syntax checkers<2>,  Next: Examples,  Prev: Error parsers,  Up: Extending Flycheck

9.5 Extending syntax checkers
=============================

There are some means to extend defined syntax checkers:

 -- Function: flycheck -add-next-checker checker next &optional append

     Add a NEXT checker after CHECKER.

     CHECKER is a syntax checker symbol, to which to add NEXT checker.

     NEXT is a cons cell ‘(LEVEL . NEXT-CHECKER)’.  NEXT-CHECKER is a
     symbol denoting the syntax checker to run after CHECKER.  LEVEL
     is an error level.  NEXT-CHECKER will only be used if there is no
     current error whose level is more severe than LEVEL.  LEVEL may
     also be t, in which case NEXT-CHECKER is used regardless of the
     current errors.

     NEXT can also be a syntax checker symbol only, which is
     equivalent to ‘(t . NEXT)’.

     NEXT-CHECKER is prepended before other next checkers, unless
     APPEND is non-nil.

 -- Function: flycheck -add-mode checker mode

     Add a new major MODE to CHECKER.

     CHECKER and MODE are symbols denoting a syntax checker and a
     major mode respectively.

     Add MODE to the ‘`:modes'’ property of CHECKER, so that CHECKER
     will be used in buffers with MODE.

9.6.1 Basic syntax checkers
---------------------------

As explained in the previous chapter *note Defining new syntax checkers:
a, a syntax checker is declared with *note flycheck-define-checker: 19.

We will use this function to define a syntax checker using the PHP
CodeSniffer utility for the PHP programming language:

     (flycheck-define-checker php-phpcs
       "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer.

     See URL `http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/'."
       :command ("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle" source)
       :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes php-mode)

     (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'php-phpcs)

First we specify the ‘:command’ to execute.  The first element of the
command list is the name of the executable, ‘phpcs’ in our case.  This
command is checked for existence with ‘executable-find’ before using
this syntax checker.  If the command does not exist, the syntax checker
is _not_ used.

The executable is following by the arguments, in this case some options
and the symbol ‘source’.  This symbol is replaced with the file to
check.  This file is a temporary file created in the system temporary
directory and containing the contents of the buffer to check.

Next we specify how to parse the output of the syntax checker.  PHP
CodeSniffer provides an option to output errors in an XML format similar
to the Java tool Checkstyle, so we use the built-in _error parser_ *note
flycheck-parse-checkstyle: 1eb. to parse the output.

Then we enable the syntax checker in PHP editing modes.

Ultimately, we make the new syntax checker available for automatic
selection by adding it to *note flycheck-checkers: 5f.

If the syntax checker does not provide any sort of structured output
format, we have to parse the error messages from the textual output.  To
do so, we can use _error patterns_, like in the Pylint syntax checker
for the Python programming language:

     (flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
       "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

     See URL `http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint'."
       :command ("epylint" source-inplace)
       :error-patterns
       ((warning line-start (file-name) ":" line
                 ": Warning (W" (zero-or-more not-newline) "): "
                 (message) line-end)
        (error line-start (file-name) ":" line
               ": Error (E" (zero-or-more not-newline) "): "
               (message) line-end)
        (error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": [F] " (message) line-end))
       :modes python-mode)

Again, there is a ‘:command’, however we use the ‘source-inplace’ symbol
this time.  This symbol causes the temporary file to be created in the
same directory as the original file, making information from the source
code tree available to the syntax checker.  In case of Pylint, these are
the Python packages from the source code tree.

Next we give the list of ‘:error-patterns’ to parse errors.  These
patterns extract the error location and the error message from the
output of ‘epylint’.  An error pattern is a list containing a regular
expression with match groups to extract the error information, and an
error level.

Eventually we enable the syntax checker in ‘python-mode’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checkers with predicates,  Next: Configuration files for syntax checkers,  Prev: Basic syntax checkers,  Up: Examples

9.6.2 Syntax checkers with predicates
-------------------------------------

In the previous examples the syntax checkers were specific to certain
major modes.  However, this is not always the case.  For instance, GNU
Emacs provides a single mode only for shell scripting in various Shell
languages.  A syntax checker for a specific shell must check whether the
edited shell script is written for the right shell:

     (flycheck-define-checker zsh
       "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

     See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
       :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": " (message) line-end))
       :modes sh-mode
       :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh)))

This syntax checker for the Zsh shell is enabled in ‘sh-mode’ as
specified by ‘:modes’, however it specifies an additional ‘:predicate’
to determine whether the right shell is in use.  Hence this syntax
checker is only used if a Zsh shell scripting is being edited in
‘sh-mode’, but not if a Bash or POSIX Shell script is being edited.

A syntax checker may even go as far as not having ‘:modes’ at all.  For
instance, there is no special JSON mode, but syntax checking JSON is
still desirable.  Hence a JSON syntax checker may use the ‘:predicate’
to check the file extension:

     (flycheck-define-checker json-jsonlint
       "A JSON syntax and style checker using jsonlint.

     See URL `https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint'."
       :command ("jsonlint" "-c" "-q" source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start
               (file-name)
               ": line " line
               ", col " column ", "
               (message) line-end))
       :predicate
       (lambda ()
         (or
          (eq major-mode 'json-mode)
          (and buffer-file-name
               (string= "json" (file-name-extension buffer-file-name))))))

This syntax checker is now used whenever a file ends with ‘.json’,
regardless of the major mode.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Configuration files for syntax checkers,  Next: Chaining syntax checkers,  Prev: Syntax checkers with predicates,  Up: Examples

9.6.3 Configuration files for syntax checkers
---------------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers can be configured using configuration files given
by an option.  Flycheck provides built-in support to handle such
configuration files:

     (flycheck-def-config-file-var flycheck-jshintrc javascript-jshint ".jshintrc")

     (flycheck-define-checker javascript-jshint
       "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

     See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
       :command ("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter"
                 (config-file "--config" flycheck-jshintrc) source)
       :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))

As you can see, we define a syntax checker for Javascript, using the
‘jshint’ utility.  This utility accepts a configuration file via the
‘--config’ option.

To use a configuration file with jshint, we first declare the variable
‘flycheck-jshintrc’ that provides the name of the file, as explained in
*note Syntax checker configuration files: 6b.

In the ‘:command’ we use a ‘config-file’ form to pass the configuration
file to the syntax checker.  If the configuration file is found, its
path will be passed to the syntax checker, using the option specified
after the ‘config-file’ symbol.  Otherwise the whole element is simply
omitted from the command line.

Some Syntax checkers can also be configured using options passed on the
command line.  Flycheck supports this case, too.  We will use this
facility to extend the PHP CodeSniffer syntax checker from the *note
Basic syntax checkers: 1ea. section with support for coding standards:

     (flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-phpcs-standard nil phpcs
       "The coding standard for PHP CodeSniffer."
       :type '(choice (const :tag "Default standard" nil)
                      (string :tag "Standard name" nil)))
     (put 'flycheck-phpcs-standard 'safe-local-variable #'stringp)

     (flycheck-declare-checker php-phpcs
       "A PHP syntax checker using PHP_CodeSniffer."
       :command '("phpcs" "--report=checkstyle"
                  (option "--standard=" flycheck-phpcs-standard concat)
                  source)
       :error-parser 'flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes 'php-mode)

The syntax checker is pretty much the same as before, except that a new
element was added to ‘:command’.  This element passes the value of the
new option variable *note flycheck-phpcs-standard: 10e. to the syntax
checker.  This variable is declared with the special macro *note
flycheck-def-option-var: 1db. at the beginning.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Chaining syntax checkers,  Prev: Configuration files for syntax checkers,  Up: Examples

9.6.4 Chaining syntax checkers
------------------------------

For many languages, more than a single syntax checker is applicable.
For instance, Emacs Lisp can be checked for syntactic corrections with
the byte code compiler, and for adherence to the Emacs Lisp
documentation style using Checkdoc.  PHP, too, can be syntax checked
with the PHP parser, and verified against coding styles using PHP
CodeSniffer.

To support such cases, syntax checkers can be *note chained: 57. using
the ‘:next-checkers’.  The standard PHP syntax checker uses this to run
PHP CodeSniffer if there are no syntax errors:

     (flycheck-define-checker php
       "A PHP syntax checker using the PHP command line interpreter.

     See URL `http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php'."
       :command ("php" "-l" "-d" "error_reporting=E_ALL" "-d" "display_errors=1"
                 "-d" "log_errors=0" source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start (or "Parse" "Fatal" "syntax") " error" (any ":" ",") " "
               (message) " in " (file-name) " on line " line line-end))
       :modes (php-mode php+-mode)
       :next-checkers ((warning . php-phpcs)))

Now PHP CodeSniffer will check the coding style, but only if PHP
CodeSniffer is a *note registered syntax checker: 61, and if ‘php’ only
emitted errors with ‘warning’ level or less, that is, no errors.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Status API,  Next: Error API,  Up: Flycheck API

10.1 Status API
===============

 -- Function: flycheck -report-status status

     Report Flycheck STATUS.

     STATUS is one of the following symbols:

     ‘`not-checked'’
          The current buffer was not checked.

     ‘`no-checker'’
          Automatic syntax checker selection did not find a suitable
          syntax checker.

     ‘`running'’
          A syntax check is now running in the current buffer.

     ‘`errored'’
          The current syntax check has errored.

     ‘`finished'’
          The current syntax check was finished normally.

     ‘`interrupted'’
          The current syntax check was interrupted.

     ‘`suspicious'’
          The last syntax check had a suspicious result.

     Set *note ‘flycheck-last-status-change’: 95. and call
     *note ‘flycheck-status-changed-functions’: 59. with STATUS.  Afterwards
     refresh the mode line.

 -- Function: flycheck -report-error

     Report a Flycheck error status.

     Clears all Flycheck errors first, runs
     *note ‘flycheck-syntax-check-failed-hook’: 5c. and reports the status with
     *note ‘flycheck-report-status’: 5a.

 -- Variable: flycheck -last-status-change

          Variable properties: Automatically becomes buffer-local when
          set.

     The last status change in the current buffer.

 -- Function: flycheck -mode-line-status-text &optional status

     Get a text describing STATUS for use in the mode line.

     STATUS defaults to *note ‘flycheck-last-status-change’: 95. if omitted or
     nil.

10.2 Error API
==============

Flycheck errors are represented by the CL structure *note
flycheck-error: 1e3.  See *note (cl)Structures:: for more information
about CL structures.

 -- CL Struct: flycheck -error

     A Flycheck error with the following slots.  Each of these slots may
     be ‘nil’.

      -- Slot: buffer

          The buffer object referring to the buffer this error belongs
          to.

               Note: You do not need to set this attribute when creating
               errors in an error parser.  Flycheck automatically keeps
               track of the buffer itself.

      -- Slot: checker

          The syntax checker that reported this error.

      -- Slot: filename

          A string containing the filename the error refers to.

      -- Slot: line

          An integer providing the line the error refers to.

      -- Slot: column

          An integer providing the column the error refers to.

          If this attribute is ‘nil’, Flycheck will assume that the
          error refers to the whole line.

      -- Slot: message

          The human-readable error message as string.

      -- Slot: level

          The error level of the message, as symbol denoting an error
          level defined with *note flycheck-define-error-level: 25.

     There are two constructors to create new *note flycheck-error: 1e3.
     objects:

      -- Function: flycheck -error-new-at line column &optional level
               message &key checker filename buffer

          Create a new Flycheck error at the given LINE and COLUMN.

          LINE and COLUMN refer to the *note line: 1f8. and *note
          column: 1f9. of the new error.  The optional LEVEL and MESSAGE
          arguments fill the *note level: 1fb. and cl-slot:‘message’
          slots respectively.

          CHECKER, FILENAME and BUFFER are keyword arguments, for *note
          checker: 1f6, *note filename: 1f7. and *note buffer: 1f5.
          respectively.  BUFFER defaults to the current buffer, the
          other two default to ‘nil’.

               Warning: Due to a limitation of Common Lisp functions in
               Emacs Lisp, you must specify *all* optional arguments,
               that is, *both* LEVEL *and* MESSAGE, to pass any keyword
               arguments.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-new &rest attributes

          Create a new *note flycheck-error: 1e3. with the given
          ATTRIBUTES.

          ATTRIBUTES is a property list, where each property specifies
          the value for the corresponding slot of *note flycheck-error:
          1e3, for instance:

               (flycheck-error-new :line 10 :column 5 :message "Foo" :level 'warning)

     The following functions and macros work on errors:

      -- Macro: flycheck -error-with-buffer err &rest forms

          Switch to the buffer of ERR and evaluate FORMS.

          If the buffer of ERR is not live, FORMS are not evaluated.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-line-region err

          Get the line region of ERR.

          ERR is a Flycheck error whose region to get.

          Return a cons cell ‘(BEG . END)’ where BEG is the first
          non-whitespace character on the line ERR refers to, and END the
          end of the line.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-column-region err

          Get the error column region of ERR.

          ERR is a Flycheck error whose region to get.

          Return a cons cell ‘(BEG . END)’ where BEG is the character
          before the error column, and END the actual error column, or nil
          if ERR has no column.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-thing-region thing err

          Get the region of THING at the column of ERR.

          ERR is a Flycheck error whose region to get.  THING is a
          understood by ‘`thing-at-point'’.

          Return a cons cell ‘(BEG . END)’ where BEG is the beginning of
          the THING at the error column, and END the end of the symbol.  If
          ERR has no error column, or if there is no THING at this column,
          return nil.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-pos err

          Get the buffer position of ERR.

          ERR is a Flycheck error whose position to get.

          The error position is the error column, or the first
          non-whitespace character of the error line, if ERR has no error column.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-format err

          Format ERR as human-readable string.

          Return a string that represents the given ERR.  This string does
          _not_ include the file name.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-< err1 err2

          Determine whether ERR1 goes before ERR2 by location.

          Compare by line numbers and then by column numbers.

      -- Function: flycheck -error-level-< err1 err2

          Determine whether ERR1 goes before ERR2 by error level.

          Like *note ‘flycheck-error-<’: 204, but compares by error level severity
          first.  Levels of the same severity are compared by name.

10.3 Error Analysis
===================

The following functions and variables may be used to analyze the errors
of a syntax check.

 -- Variable: flycheck -current-errors

          Variable properties: Automatically becomes buffer-local when
          set.

     A list of all errors and warnings in the current buffer.

 -- Function: flycheck -count-errors errors

     Count the number of ERRORS, grouped by level..

     Return an alist, where each ITEM is a cons cell whose ‘`car'’ is an
     error level, and whose ‘`cdr'’ is the number of errors of that
     level.

 -- Function: flycheck -has-errors-p errors level

     Determine if there are any ERRORS with LEVEL.

 -- Function: flycheck -has-max-errors-p errors level

     Check if there is no error in ERRORS more severe than LEVEL.

10.4 Builtin error parsers
==========================

 -- Function: flycheck -parse-with-patterns output checker _buffer

     Parse OUTPUT from CHECKER with error patterns.

     Uses the error patterns of CHECKER to tokenize the output and
     tries to parse each error token with all patterns, in the order
     of declaration.  Hence an error is never matched twice by two
     different patterns.  The pattern declared first always wins.

     _BUFFER is ignored.

     Return a list of parsed errors and warnings (as ‘`flycheck-error'’
     objects).

 -- Function: flycheck -parse-checkstyle output _checker _buffer

     Parse Checkstyle errors from OUTPUT.

     Parse Checkstyle-like XML output.  Use this error parser for
     checkers that have an option to output errors in this format.

     _CHECKER and _BUFFER are ignored.

     See URL ‘http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/’(1) for information
     about Checkstyle.

10.5 Error parser API
=====================

These functions can be used to implement custom error parsers:

 -- Function: flycheck -parse-xml-string xml

     Parse an XML string.

     Return the document tree parsed from XML in the form ‘(ROOT ATTRS
     BODY...)’.  ROOT is a symbol identifying the name of the root
     element.  ATTRS is an alist of the attributes of the root node.
     BODY is zero or more body elements, either as strings (in case of
     text nodes) or as XML nodes, in the same for as the root node.

10.6 Error filters
==================

 -- Function: flycheck -sanitize-errors errors

     Sanitize ERRORS.

     Sanitize ERRORS by trimming leading and trailing whitespace in
     all error messages, and by replacing 0 columns and empty error
     messages with nil.

     Returns sanitized ERRORS.

 -- Function: flycheck -collapse-error-message-whitespace errors

     Collapse whitespace in all messages of ERRORS.

     Return ERRORS.

 -- Function: flycheck -fold-include-errors


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checker API,  Next: Builtin option filters,  Prev: Error filters,  Up: Flycheck API

10.7 Syntax checker API
=======================

 -- Function: flycheck -registered-checker-p checker

     Determine whether CHECKER is registered.

     A checker is registered if it is contained in
     *note ‘flycheck-checkers’: 5f.

 -- Function: flycheck -substitute-argument arg checker

     Substitute ARG for CHECKER.

     Return a list of real arguments for the executable of CHECKER,
     substituted for the symbolic argument ARG.  Single arguments,
     e.g. if ARG is a literal strings, are wrapped in a list.

     ARG may be one of the following forms:

     STRING
          Return ARG unchanged.

     ‘`source'’, ‘`source-inplace'’
          Create a temporary file to check and return its path.  With
          ‘`source-inplace'’ create the temporary file in the same
          directory as the original file.  The value of
          *note ‘flycheck-temp-prefix’: 5d. is used as prefix of the file name.

          With ‘`source'’, try to retain the non-directory component of
          the buffer’s file name in the temporary file.

          ‘`source'’ is the preferred way to pass the input file to a
          syntax checker.  ‘`source-inplace'’ should only be used if the
          syntax checker needs other files from the source directory,
          such as include files in C.

     ‘`source-original'’
          Return the path of the actual file to check, or an empty
          string if the buffer has no file name.

          Note that the contents of the file may not be up to date
          with the contents of the buffer to check.  Do not use this
          as primary input to a checker, unless absolutely necessary.

          When using this symbol as primary input to the syntax
          checker, add *note ‘flycheck-buffer-saved-p’: 214. to the ‘`:predicate'’.

     ‘`temporary-directory'’
          Create a unique temporary directory and return its path.

     ‘`temporary-file-name'’
          Return a unique temporary filename.  The file is *not*
          created.

          To ignore the output of syntax checkers, try ‘`null-device'’
          first.

     ‘`null-device'’
          Return the value of ‘`null-device'’, i.e the system null
          device.

          Use this option to ignore the output of a syntax checker.
          If the syntax checker cannot handle the null device, or
          won’t write to an existing file, try ‘`temporary-file-name'’
          instead.

     ‘(config-file OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN])’
          Search the configuration file bound to VARIABLE with
          *note ‘flycheck-locate-config-file’: 215. and return a list of arguments
          that pass this configuration file to the syntax checker, or
          nil if the configuration file was not found.

          PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the located
          configuration file, and should return OPTION prepended
          before the file, either a string or as list.  If omitted,
          PREPEND-FN defaults to ‘`list'’.

     ‘(option OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])’
          Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return a list of
          arguments that pass this value as value for OPTION to the
          syntax checker.

          PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and the value of
          VARIABLE, and should return OPTION prepended before the
          file, either a string or as list.  If omitted, PREPEND-FN
          defaults to ‘`list'’.

          FILTER is an optional function to be applied to the value of
          VARIABLE before prepending.  This function must return nil
          or a string.  In the former case, return nil.  In the latter
          case, return a list of arguments as described above.

     ‘(option-list OPTION VARIABLE [PREPEND-FN [FILTER]])’
          Retrieve the value of VARIABLE, which must be a list,
          and prepend OPTION before each item in this list, using
          PREPEND-FN.

          PREPEND-FN is called with the OPTION and each item of the
          list as second argument, and should return OPTION prepended
          before the item, either as string or as list.  If omitted,
          PREPEND-FN defaults to ‘`list'’.

          FILTER is an optional function to be applied to each item in
          the list before prepending OPTION.  It shall return the
          option value for each item as string, or nil, if the item is
          to be ignored.

     ‘(option-flag OPTION VARIABLE)’
          Retrieve the value of VARIABLE and return OPTION, if the
          value is non-nil.  Otherwise return nil.

     ‘(eval FORM)’
          Return the result of evaluating FORM in the buffer to be
          checked.  FORM must either return a string or a list of
          strings, or nil to indicate that nothing should be
          substituted for CELL.  For all other return types, signal an
          error

          _No_ further substitutions are performed, neither in FORM
          before it is evaluated, nor in the result of evaluating
          FORM.

     In all other cases, signal an error.

     Note that substitution is *not* recursive.  No symbols or cells
     are substituted within the body of cells!

 -- Function: flycheck -locate-config-file filename checker

     Locate the configuration file FILENAME for CHECKER.

     Locate the configuration file using
     *note ‘flycheck-locate-config-file-functions’: 6d.

     Return the absolute path of the configuration file, or nil if no
     configuration file was found.

 -- Function: flycheck -define-error-level level &rest properties

     Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

     The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

     ‘:severity SEVERITY’
          A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
          the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
          levels.  Defaults to 0.

          The severity is used by *note ‘flycheck-error-level-<’: 205. to
          determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

     ‘:overlay-category CATEGORY’
          A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
          highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
          node *note (elisp)Overlay Properties:: for more information about
          overlay categories.

          A category for an error level overlay should at least define
          the ‘`face'’ property, for error highlighting.  Other useful
          properties for error level categories are ‘`priority'’ to
          influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays, and
          ‘`help-echo'’ to define a default error messages for errors
          without messages.

     ‘:fringe-bitmap BITMAP’
          A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
          indicators for this level.  See Info node *note (elisp)Fringe Bitmaps:: for more information about fringe bitmaps,
          including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

     ‘:fringe-face FACE’
          A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
          for this level.

     ‘:error-list-face FACE’
          A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
          level in the error list.  See *note ‘flycheck-list-errors’: 47.

10.8 Builtin option filters
===========================

 -- Function: flycheck -option-int value

     Convert an integral option VALUE to a string.

     If VALUE is nil, return nil.  Otherwise return VALUE converted to
     a string.

 -- Function: flycheck -option-comma-separated-list value &optional
          separator filter

     Convert VALUE into a list separated by SEPARATOR.

     SEPARATOR is a string to separate items in VALUE, defaulting to
     ",".  FILTER is an optional function, which takes a single
     argument and returns either a string or nil.

     If VALUE is a list, apply FILTER to each item in VALUE, remove
     all nil items, and return a single string of all remaining items
     separated by SEPARATOR.

     Otherwise, apply FILTER to VALUE and return the result.
     SEPARATOR is ignored in this case.
