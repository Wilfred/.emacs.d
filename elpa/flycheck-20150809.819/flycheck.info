1 Introduction
**************

Flycheck provides modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for GNU
Emacs 24, intended as replacement for the older Flymake extension which
is part of GNU Emacs.

   Flycheck runs various linting tools and services to automatically
check the contents of buffers while you are typing, and reports warnings
and errors directly in the buffer, in the mode line and in an optional
error list.  You can navigate errors and warnings in the current buffer,
show the corresponding messages, and copy errors to the kill ring.

   • Over 40 languages with more than 70 checkers.  *Note Supported
     languages::.
   • Fully automatic, fail-safe, on-the-fly syntax checking in buffers
   • In-buffer error highlighting, with fringe indicators
   • Error navigation
   • Auto-updating error list
   • Many customisation options
   • A comprehensive manual
   • A simple API to add support for new languages and tools
   • A “doesn’t get in your way guarantee”


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Quickstart,  Prev: Introduction,  Up: Top

2 Installation
**************

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

Flycheck needs GNU Emacs 24.  Older releases of GNU Emacs or other
flavours of Emacs (e.g.  XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.)  are _not_ supported.

   Flycheck works best on Unix-like operating systems.  It is
extensively tested on Linux and OS X.

   *Warning:* Flycheck tries to maintain compatibility with Windows as
well, and generally works well on Windows.  Pull requests which fix or
improve Windows compatibility are _very_ welcome.  However, Flycheck
does not explicitly support Windows.  If there are issues or problems on
Windows, _you are on your own_.  The Flycheck developers cannot answer
questions about Windows, or fix Windows-specific issues.

2.2 Syntax checking tools
=========================

Flycheck does _not_ check buffers itself.  It relies on _external_
programs to check buffers, which need to be installed separately.  *Note
Supported languages::, for a list of required programs for each language
supported by Flycheck.

   Most of these programs are available in the package repositories of
Linux distributions, or with the standard package managers of specific
programming languages (e.g.  Rubygems, NPM, Cabal, etc.)

2.3 Installation
================

Install Flycheck via Emacs’ built-in package manager, from the MELPA
Stable (http://stable.melpa.org) repository:

     M-x package-install RET flycheck

   Alternatively, you may use the MELPA (http://melpa.org) repository,
which hosts the most recent development version.  Note that these
repositories are not included in GNU Emacs by default.

   You need to enable them explicitly, by adding the following to your
init file:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)

   *Warning:* Flycheck is available from Marmalade
(https://marmalade-repo.org/), but due to frequent outages of this
repository we recommend against it.

2.4 Cask
========

If you use Cask (https://github.com/cask/cask) to manage your packages,
add the following to your ‘Cask’ file:

     (source gnu)
     (source melpa-stable)

     (depends-on "flycheck")


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Quickstart,  Next: Usage,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Quickstart
************

3.1 Install and enable Flycheck
===============================

To get started with Flycheck, enable it by adding the following to your
init file:

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

   If you don’t know where your init file is take a look at the value of
the variable ‘user-init-file’ with ‘C-h v user-init-file’.

3.2 Install syntax checker tools
================================

Next you need to install syntax checking tools for the major modes you
are using.  For instance, for Python you may want to install Pylint
(http://pylint.org):

     $ pip install pylint

   For Ruby, you might want to use Rubocop
(https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and ruby-lint
(https://github.com/YorickPeterse/ruby-lint):

     $ gem install rubocop ruby-lint

   *Note Supported languages::, for a complete list of all languages
that Flycheck supports.

3.3 Check syntax in a buffer
============================

Now switch to a Python or Ruby Mode buffer and run ‘M-x
flycheck-verify-setup’ to check whether Flycheck is correctly setup.

   If everything is fine Flycheck will now check syntax using these
tools, when you visit a buffer in any of these languages.  Syntax
checking happens _automatically_ when you save the buffer or make any
changes.  Flycheck highlights errors and warnings in the buffer,
indicates them in the fringe, and reports their numbers in the mode
line.

   You can also manually check a buffer with ‘C-c ! c’
(‘flycheck-buffer’).

3.4 Navigate and list errors
============================

Use ‘C-c ! n’ (‘flycheck-next-error’) and ‘C-c ! p’
(‘flycheck-previous-error’) to navigate between error locations.  If you
keep the point at an error location, Flycheck will show the error
message in the echo area after a short delay.  You can also hover error
locations with the mouse and see the error message in a tooltip.

   To get an overview of all errors and warnings in the current buffer,
type ‘C-c ! l’ (‘flycheck-list-errors’) to pop up a list of all errors
in your current buffer.  The error list updates automatically when you
fix errors or introduce new ones, or when you switch to another buffer.

3.5 More features
=================

All Flycheck commands are available in the Emacs menu at ‘Syntax
checking’ in the ‘Tools’ menu.

   The same menu is also available by clicking on the mode line lighter
of Flycheck.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Checking buffers,  Next: Syntax checkers,  Up: Usage

4.1 Checking buffers
====================

The minor mode ‘flycheck-mode’ enables syntax checking in a single
buffer.  ‘global-flycheck-mode’ automatically enables ‘flycheck-mode’
all buffers whenever possible.  You can exclude specific major modes
from ‘global-flycheck-mode’ with ‘flycheck-global-modes’.

   *Note:* ‘global-flycheck-mode’ does not enable ‘flycheck-mode’ for
remote or encrypted files.  The former is flaky and might be very slow,
and the latter would leak confidential data to temporary directories.
You may still check syntax in these buffers by manually enabling
‘flycheck-mode’ with ‘M-x flycheck-mode’.  However, this is _not_
recommended for said reasons.

   Add the following code to your init file to enable syntax checking
permanently:

     (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)

   When ‘flycheck-mode’ is enabled, Flycheck automatically checks a
buffer whenever

   • the buffer is saved,
   • new lines are inserted,
   • or a short time after you stopped to make changes to the buffer.

   You can customise this behaviour by changing
‘flycheck-check-syntax-automatically’:

 -- User Option: flycheck-check-syntax-automatically
     A list of events that trigger a new syntax check in the current
     buffer:

     ‘save’
          Check the buffer immediately after it was saved.
     ‘idle-change’
          Check the buffer a short time after the last change to the
          buffer.  The delay is customisable with
          ‘flycheck-idle-change-delay’.
     ‘new-line’
          Check the buffer immediately after a new line was inserted.
     ‘mode-enabled’
          Check the buffer immediately after Flycheck Mode was enabled.

     For instance, with the following code in your init file Flycheck
     will only check the buffer when it is saved, but never while you
     are making changes to the buffer:

          (setq flycheck-check-syntax-automatically '(mode-enabled save))

   In addition to automatic syntax checking you can always check the
current buffer manually:

‘C-c ! c’
‘M-x flycheck-buffer’
     Check syntax in the current buffer.

*Note:* If syntax checking does not work, please check your setup:

‘C-c ! v’
‘M-x flycheck-verify-setup’
     Popup a buffer with information about the Flycheck setup for the
     current buffer.

     Lists the syntax checkers available for the current buffer,
     together with potential problems in their setup.

   During syntax checks Flycheck creates temporary files to feed to
contents of the current buffer to external programs.  You can change the
prefix used for the names of these temporary files with
‘flycheck-temp-prefix’.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Syntax checkers,  Next: Reporting results,  Prev: Checking buffers,  Up: Usage

4.2 Syntax checkers
===================

Flycheck does not check buffers by itself, but relies on external
_syntax checkers_.  When checking a buffer Flycheck automatically
selects the best syntax checker from ‘flycheck-checkers’:

 -- User Option: flycheck-checkers
     A list of all syntax checkers available for syntax checking.

     A syntax checker in this list is a _registered_ syntax checker.

   Flycheck may apply further syntax checkers to the current buffer, if
the selected syntax checker _chains_ to other syntax checkers.  For
instance, the ‘emacs-lisp’ syntax checker, which checks Emacs Lisp with
Emacs’ byte compiler, _chains_ to the ‘emacs-lisp-checkdoc’ syntax
checker, which checks Emacs Lisp for violations of documentation
conventions, *note (elisp)Documentation Tips::.  In Emacs Lisp buffers,
Flycheck will first use ‘emacs-lisp’, and then ‘emacs-lisp-checkdoc’.

   Flycheck ignores chained checkers which are not contained in
‘flycheck-checkers’.

   Like everything else in GNU Emacs, syntax checkers have online
documentation as well.  If you are interested what major modes a
particular syntax checker in ‘flycheck-checkers’ supports, or what tool
it uses, type <C-c ! ?>:

‘C-c ! ?’
‘M-x flycheck-describe-checker’
     Prompt for a syntax checker and show its documentation.

     The documentation includes the name of the program or service used
     by the syntax checker, a list of major modes in which the checker
     will be used, and a list of its options.

   Instead of letting Flycheck select a syntax checker automatically you
can also explicitly tell Flycheck which checker to use for the current
buffer, by manually selecting a specific syntax checker:

‘C-c ! s’
‘M-x flycheck-select-checker’
     Prompt for a syntax checker and select this syntax checker for the
     current buffer.

‘C-u C-c ! s’
‘C-u M-x flycheck-select-checker’ Remove any manual
     syntax checker selection for the current buffer, and let Flycheck
     automatically select a syntax checker from ‘flycheck-checkers’
     again.

   You can also select a syntax checker via the variable
‘flycheck-checker’.  In fact, ‘flycheck-select-checker’ just sets this
variable accordingly:

 -- Variable: flycheck-checker
     A syntax checker to use for the current buffer.

     If nil (the default), Flycheck will automatically select the best
     checker from ‘flycheck-checkers’.

     If set to a syntax checker, Flycheck will use this syntax checker
     for the current buffer, and never automatically select any other.
     Flycheck still runs chained checkers, though.

     If the syntax checker selected by this variable does not work in
     the current buffer, Flycheck signals an error.

     You can set this variable locally.  For instance, if your Python
     project mandates Flake8 (http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/2.2.3/)
     as a syntax checker, you can tell Flycheck to only use the
     corresponding checker ‘python-flake8’ in Python files of your
     project by setting ‘flycheck-checker’ as a directory-local variable
     in the top-level directory of your project with ‘M-x
     add-dir-local-variable RET python-mode RET flycheck-checker RET
     python-flake8’.  *Note (emacs)Directory Variables::, for more
     information about directory variables.

   Occasionally you may want to disable specific syntax checkers
completely, so that they can never be used at all, neither via automatic
nor via manual selection:

‘C-c ! x’
‘M-x flycheck-disable-checker’
     Prompt for a syntax checker to disable in the current buffer.

‘C-u C-c ! x’
‘C-u M-x flycheck-disable-checker’
     Prompt for a syntax checker to re-enable in the current buffer.

   This is particularly useful if you want to disable syntax checkers
that are chained after others.  For instance, if you do not care for
documentation conventions of Emacs Lisp you may not need for the
‘emacs-lisp-checkdoc’ checker, so you can disable it for the current
buffer with <M-x flycheck-disable-checker RET emacs-lisp-checkdoc>.

   ‘flycheck-disable-checker’ actually sets the buffer-local value of
the ‘flycheck-disabled-checkers’ option:

 -- User Option: flycheck-disabled-checkers
     A list of disabled syntax checkers.  Flycheck will _never_ use
     disabled syntax checkers to check a buffer.

     You can customise this variable with <M-x customize-variable RET
     flycheck-disabled-checkers> or set its default value in your init
     file to permanently disable specific checkers.  For instance, to
     permanently disable Clang for all C/C++ buffers:

          (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(c/c++-clang))

     You can also disable checkers via local variables.  For instance,
     to disable ‘emacs-lisp-checkdoc’ for your entire project, add it to
     ‘flycheck-disabled-checkers’ in the ‘.dir-locals.el’ file of your
     project:

          ((emacs-lisp-mode (flycheck-disabled-checkers emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))

     *Note (emacs)Directory Variables::, for more information about
     directory variables.

   You can change the completion system used by the commands of this
section with ‘flycheck-completion-system’.

4.3 Reporting results of syntax checking
========================================

When a syntax check in the current buffer has finished, Flycheck reports
the results of the syntax checkers used by the check in the current
buffer:

   • It highlights errors and warnings reported by a syntax checking in
     the buffer according to ‘flycheck-highlighting-mode’,
   • and indicates these locations in the fringe according to
     ‘flycheck-indication-mode’.

 -- User Option: flycheck-highlighting-mode
     How Flycheck highlights errors and warnings in the buffer:

     ‘columns’
          Highlight the column of the error, if the error has a column,
          otherwise behave as ‘lines’.
     ‘symbols’
          Highlight the symbol at the error column, if any, otherwise
          behave like ‘columns’.  This is default
     ‘sexps’
          Highlight the expression at the error column, if any,
          otherwise behave like ‘columns’.  *Warning:* ‘sexps’ can be
          _very_ slow in some major modes, notably the built-in
          ‘python-mode’.
     ‘nil’
          Do not highlight errors at all.

     Flycheck uses the ‘flycheck-error’, ‘flycheck-warning’ and
     ‘flycheck-info’ faces to highlight errors, warnings and info
     messages respectively.

 -- User Option: flycheck-indication-mode
     How Flycheck indicates errors and warnings:

     ‘left-fringe’
     ‘right-fringe’
          Indicate errors in the left or right fringe respectively.
          *Note (emacs)Fringes::, for more information about fringes.

          Flycheck uses the ‘flycheck-fringe-error’,
          ‘flycheck-fringe-warning’, and ‘flycheck-fringe-info’ faces
          for the indicators for the corresponding error levels.
     ‘nil’
          Do not indicate errors and warnings.

   To avoid flooding a buffer with excessive reports, Flycheck discards
any reports and _disables_ the corresponding syntax checker
subsequently, if the total number of reported errors of any level
exceeds the value of ‘flycheck-checker-error-threshold’.

   You can explicitly clear with the ‘flycheck-clear’ command.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Navigating errors,  Next: Displaying errors,  Prev: Reporting results,  Up: Usage

4.4 Navigating errors
=====================

By default, Flycheck integrates into standard error navigation commands
of Emacs: ‘M-g n’ (‘next-error’) and ‘M-g p’ (‘previous-error’) will
navigate between Flycheck warnings and errors in the current buffer.
*Note (emacs)Compilation Mode::, for more information about these
commands.  You can disable this integration by setting
‘flycheck-standard-error-navigation’ to nil, and re-enabling
‘flycheck-mode’ afterwards.

   *Note:* With standard error navigation _visible_ compilation buffers
(e.g.  from M-x compile, M-x grep, M-x occur, etc.)  take precedence
over Flycheck errors.

   Flycheck provides an independent set of navigation commands which
will always navigate Flycheck errors in the current buffer, regardless
of visible compilation buffers and ‘flycheck-standard-error-navigation’:

‘C-c ! n’
‘M-x flycheck-next-error’
     Jump to the next error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards by as many errors as specified
     by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 C-c ! n’ will move to the 3rd
     error from the current point.  With negative prefix argument, move
     to previous errors instead.  Signal an error, if there are no more
     Flycheck errors.

‘C-c ! p’
‘M-x flycheck-previous-error’
     Jump to the previous Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump backwards by as many errors as specified
     by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 C-c ! p’ will move to the 3rd
     error before the current point.  With negative prefix argument,
     move to next errors instead.  Signal an error, if there are no more
     Flycheck errors.

‘M-x flycheck-first-error’
     Jump to the first Flycheck error.

     With prefix argument, jump forwards to by as many errors as
     specified by the prefix argument, e.g.  ‘M-3 M-x
     flycheck-first-error’ moves to the 3rd error from the beginning of
     the buffer.  With negative prefix argument, move to the last error
     instead.

   By default, these commands consider all errors in the current buffer.
With ‘flycheck-navigation-minimum-level’ you can restrict them to errors
above certain levels:

 -- User Option: flycheck-navigation-minimum-level
     The minimum levels of errors to consider for navigation.

     If set to an error level, only navigate to errors whose level is as
     least as severe as this one.  If nil, navigate to all errors.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Displaying errors,  Next: Killing errors,  Prev: Navigating errors,  Up: Usage

4.5 Displaying errors
=====================

If the point is on a Flycheck error, Flycheck will display the message
and ID of the error at point in the echo area after a short delay.

 -- User Option: flycheck-display-errors-delay
     The number of seconds to wait before displaying the error at point.
     Floating point numbers can express fractions of seconds.

   You can set ‘flycheck-display-errors-function’ to change how Flycheck
displays error, and what information it displays:

 -- User Option: flycheck-display-errors-function
     A function to display errors.  The function is called with a list
     of Flycheck error objects to display.  *Note Errors::, for more
     information about these objects.

   Flycheck provides some built-in display functions:

 -- Function: flycheck-display-error-messages
     Show error messages and IDs in the echo area.

 -- Function: flycheck-display-error-messages-unless-error-list
     Like ‘flycheck-display-error-messages’, but does not show anything
     if the error list is visible.  *Note Listing errors::, for more
     information about the error list.

   The flycheck-pos-tip (https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-pos-tip)
extension provides an alternative display function, which shows error
messages in a graphical popup.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Killing errors,  Next: Listing errors,  Prev: Displaying errors,  Up: Usage

4.6 Killing errors
==================

You can also put error messages into the kill ring:

‘C-c ! C-w’
‘M-x flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill’
     Copy all Flycheck error messages at point into the kill ring.

     Each error message is killed _separately_, so ‘C-y’ (‘yank’) only
     yanks a single error message.  You can use ‘M-y’ (‘yank-pop’) to
     cycle between the killed messages after yanking the first one.

‘C-u C-c ! C-w’
‘C-u M-x flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill’
     Copy all Flycheck error messages at point, including their IDs.

‘M-0 C-c ! C-w’
‘M-0 M-x flycheck-copy-errors-as-kill’
     Copy the IDs of the errors at point.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Listing errors,  Next: Mode line display,  Prev: Killing errors,  Up: Usage

4.7 Listing errors
==================

To get an overview of all errors in the current buffer you can popup an
error list:

‘C-c ! l’
‘M-x flycheck-list-errors’
‘M-x list-flycheck-errors’
     List all errors in the current buffer.

     The error list automatically refreshes itself after a syntax check.
     It also follows the current buffer and window, and automatically
     updates to show the errors of the new buffer if you switch to
     another buffer or window.  After each refresh the hook
     ‘flycheck-error-list-after-refresh-hook’.

   In the error list window the following keybindings are available:

‘n’
     Move to the next error.
‘p’
     Move to the previous error.
‘f’
     Filter the list, showing only errors whose level is above a
     threshold of your choice.
‘F’
     Remove all filters.
‘q’
     Hide the error list window.
‘RET’
     Jump to the location of the error at point.
‘g’
     Refresh the error list, by triggering a new syntax check in the
     associated buffer.
‘S’
     Sort the error list by the column at point.  Press repeatedly to
     inverse the sorting order.

     For instance, you can sort errors by their level by moving the
     point onto the text of the ‘Level’ column, and then pressing ‘S’.
     You can achieve the same effect by clicking on the column header.

   By default, the error list shows all errors in the current buffer.
In addition to filtering manually, you can restrict it to errors above
certain levels with ‘flycheck-error-list-minimum-level’:

 -- User Option: flycheck-error-list-minimum-level
     The minimum level of errors to display in the error list.

     If set to an error level, only displays errors whose error level is
     at least as severe as this one in the error list.  If nil, display
     all errors.

   When you move the point in the current buffer while the error list is
visible, all errors on the current line are highlighted in the error
list with the ‘flycheck-error-list-highlight’ face.

4.8 Mode line display
=====================

Flycheck always indicates its current state in the mode line, with one
of the following strings:

‘FlyC’
     There are no errors in the current buffer.
‘FlyC*’
     Flycheck currently checks the current buffer.
‘FlyC:3/5’
     There are three errors and five warnings in the current buffer.
‘FlyC-’
     Flycheck did not find any syntax checker for the current buffer.
     Try ‘C-c ! v’ (‘flycheck-verify-setup’) to find out why.
‘FlyC!’
     The syntax check failed.  Inspect the ‘*Messages*’ buffer for more
     information about the failure.
‘FlyC?’
     The syntax check had a dubious result.  The definition of the
     syntax checker may be flawed.  Inspect the ‘*Messages*’ buffer for
     details.

   This indicator should *never* appear for built-in syntax checkers.
If it does, please consider reporting an issue to the Flycheck
developers.  *Note Issues::, for more information.

   The 3rd party extension flycheck-color-mode-line
(https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-color-mode-line) automatically
changes the background colour of the mode line according to the results
of the last syntax check.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Configuring checkers,  Prev: Mode line display,  Up: Usage

4.9 Configuring syntax checkers
===============================

Flycheck provides a rich interface to configure syntax checkers.  There
are three different kinds of options for syntax checkers:

   • _Syntax checker options_ which directly change specific settings of
     syntax checkers,
   • _syntax checker configuration files_ which point syntax checkers to
     configuration files which can comprehensively configure a syntax
     checker, and
   • _syntax checker executables_ which change the executables that
     Flycheck runs for syntax checkers.

4.9.1 Syntax checker options
----------------------------

Man syntax checkers can be configured via individual options.  For
instance, the ‘flycheck-flake8-maximum-line-length’ tells the
‘python-flake8’ syntax checker about the maximum number of characters
allowed on a line.  Use the command ‘flycheck-describe-checker’ to see
what options a syntax checker provides.  Type ‘M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-options’ to get a list of all available options.

   Options are mainly intended to be set per file or per project via
file or directory variables.  *Note (emacs)File Variables::, and *note
(emacs)Directory Variables:: respectively, for more information.

   For instance, if you the following file variables section at the end
of a Python file, the ‘python-flake8’ syntax checker will warn about
lines longer than 100 characters, rather than the default limit of 80
characters:

     # Local Variables:
     # flycheck-flake8-maximum-line-length: 100
     # End:

4.9.2 Syntax checker configuration files
----------------------------------------

Some syntax checkers also read configuration files.  These syntax
checkers have an associated _configuration file variable_ which
specifies the path to the configuration file.  All configuration file
variables are customisable via ‘M-x customize-group RET
flycheck-config-files’.

   If the value of a configuration file variable is nil, Flycheck will
not use any configuration file for the corresponding syntax checker.  If
it is a string, however, Flycheck tries to locate an appropriate
configuration file, with the following procedure:

  1. If the value contains a directory separator, expand the path
     against the ‘default-directory’ of the current buffer.
  2. If the buffer has a file name, search the buffer’s directory and
     any ancestor directories up to the root directory for the
     configuration file.
  3. Eventually try to find the configuration file in the user’s home
     directory.

   If any of these steps returns an existing file, this file is given to
the syntax checker.  For instance, assume you edit the file
‘foo/bar/hello.py’ in the following project layout:

     .
     ├── .pylintrc
     ├── README.rst
     ├── foo
     │   ├── __init__.py
     │   └── bar
     │       ├── __init__.py
     │       └── hello.py
     └── setup.py

   When using the ‘python-pylint’ syntax checker, Flycheck would find
the file ‘.pylintrc’ and pass it to ‘pylint’.  This file could then
contain project-wide style settings for your Python code.

   You can change the default procedure for locating configuration files
by adding or replacing functions in
‘flycheck-locate-config-file-functions’:

 -- User Option: flycheck-locate-config-file-functions
     Functions to locate configuration files.

     Each function accepts two arguments VALUE and CHECKER.  VALUE is
     the value of the configuration file variable, and CHECKER is the
     syntax checker to locate a configuration file for.  The function
     shall either return a string with the absolute path to an existing
     configuration file, or nil if it could not locate the file.

     Flycheck calls the functions in order of appearance, until the
     first function returns nil.  If all functions return nil, no
     configuration file is given to the syntax checker.

   *Note:* The formats of configuration files are specific to each
syntax checker.  Please consult the documentation of the corresponding
checker tool for information about the configuration file format
understood by the tool.

   Like syntax checker options (*note Syntax checker options::) you can
set these variables with file or directory variables.  *Note (emacs)File
Variables::, and *note (emacs)Directory Variables:: respectively, for
more information.

4.9.3 Syntax checker executables
--------------------------------

Occasionally, you need to point Flycheck to a different executable when
running a syntax checker.  For instance, you might want to use ‘gcc-4.9’
to check your C code, or use ‘pylint’ from a specific virtualenv.

   For these situations, each syntax checker has a buffer-local,
customizable variable named ‘flycheck-CHECKER-executable’, where CHECKER
is the name of the syntax checker.  The value of this variable is either
nil, or a string.  In the former case, Flycheck uses the default
executable from the syntax checker definition when executing the syntax
checker.  In the latter case, it uses the value of the variable as
executable.

   You can either set these variables directly in your init file, or
change them interactively:

‘C-c ! e’
‘M-x flycheck-set-checker-executable’
     Set the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and an executable file, and set the
     executable variable of the syntax checker.
‘C-u C-c ! e’
‘C-u M-x flycheck-set-checker-executable’
     Reset the executable of a syntax checker in the current buffer.

     Prompt for a syntax checker and reset its executable to the
     default.

File: flycheck.info,  Node: Defining syntax checkers,  Next: Finding error patterns,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.1 Defining syntax checkers
============================

Flycheck provides the macro ‘flycheck-define-checker’ to define a new
syntax checker.  The following example defines a simple syntax checker
for the popular Pylint (http://www.pylint.org/) tool for Python:

     (flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
       "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

     See URL `http://www.pylint.org/'."
       :command ("pylint"
                 "--msg-template" "{path}:{line}:{column}:{C}:{msg} ({msg_id})"
                 source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
               (or "E" "F") ":" (message) line-end)
        (warning line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
                 (or "W" "R") ":" (message) line-end)
        (info line-start (file-name) ":" line ":" column ":"
              "C:" (message) line-end))
       :modes python-mode)

   The first argument to ‘flycheck-define-checker’ is the _name_ of a
syntax checker, by which we can refer to this particular syntax checker.

   Next comes the _docstring_, which should provide a bit of information
about the syntax checker.  It’s a good idea to provide a link to the
homepage of the syntax checker tool here.  You can view this docstring
in Emacs with ‘flycheck-describe-checker’ at ‘C-c ! ?’, e.g.  ‘C-c ! ?
python-pylint’.

   Eventually we specify the _properties_ of the new syntax checker.
These properties tell Flycheck when to use your new syntax checker, how
to run it, and how to parse its output:

   • The ‘:command’ specifies the command Flycheck should run to check
     the buffer.  It’s a simple list containing the executable and its
     arguments.

     In our example we first the ‘--msg-template’ option to ‘pylint’ to
     configure a comprehensive and parseable output format.

     Then we use the “special” ‘source’ argument to pass the contents of
     the buffer as input file to ‘pylint’.  Whenever it sees the
     ‘source’ argument, Flycheck creates a temporary file, fills it with
     the current contents of the buffer and passes that file to the
     syntax checker.  This allows to check the real contents of a buffer
     even if the buffer is not saved to disk.

     Refer to the function ‘flycheck-substitute-argument’ for a complete
     list of all special symbols.

   • The ‘:error-patterns’ tell Flycheck how to parse the output of the
     command in order to obtain error locations.  Each pattern has a
     _level_, followed by ‘rx’ forms which specify a regular expression
     to find an error in the output of the command.

     Flycheck understands three error levels by default: ‘error’ is for
     critical errors that absolutely require the user’s attention (e.g.
     syntax errors), ‘warning’ is for issues that can be ignored, but
     should not (e.g.  unused variables), and ‘info’ is for other
     messages that provide information about the buffer, but do not
     immediately require action from the user.
     ‘flycheck-define-error-level’ lets you define custom error levels.

     Flycheck provides special ‘rx’ forms to extract the relevant
     information from each error:

        • The ‘(file-name)’ and ‘(message)’ forms match a sequence of
          any character save new line as file name and message of the
          error.  Both optionally accept further ‘rx’ forms, to specify
          an alternative regular expression to match the file name or
          the message, for instance to parse multi-line error messages.
        • The ‘line’ and ‘column’ forms match a sequence of one or more
          digits as line and column respectively of the error.

     Refer to the function ‘flycheck-rx-to-string’ for a complete list
     of supported forms.

   • The ‘:modes’ property denotes the major modes, in which Flycheck
     may use this syntax checker.  ‘pylint’ checks Javascript, so the
     ‘:modes’ of our example specify ‘python-mode’.

5.2 Finding the right error patterns
====================================

Finding the right error patterns is the hardest part of a syntax checker
definition.  For a first version, you just run the tool on a file, look
at its output and write a regular expression to match it.  ‘M-x shell’
comes handy here.

   However, as you start to debug and refine your patterns, this quickly
becomes cumbersome.  Flycheck provides an easier way to test a syntax
checker: Evaluate the syntax checker definition with ‘C-M-x’ and run
‘flycheck-compile’.

‘C-c ! C-c’
‘M-x flycheck-compile’
     Run a syntax checker on the current buffer in a fresh Compilation
     Mode buffer.  Prompt for a syntax checker to run.

   This command runs the command like a normal syntax check would do,
but instead of highlighting errors within the buffer it shows a new
buffer in Compilation Mode, which contains the entire output of the
command and highlights everything that matches a pattern.  You can then
refine the error pattern, and iterate through this process until the
error pattern is complete.  ‘M-x re-builder’ can help you to quickly
develop patterns for the current output.

   Sometimes however an output format doesn’t lend itself to error
patterns.  In this case, you need to write a more sophisticated parser
yourself.  *Note Parsing structured output::, for more information.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Trying new checkers,  Next: Registering new checkers,  Prev: Finding error patterns,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.3 Trying a new syntax checker
===============================

After evaluating a syntax checker definition you can try whether it
works for normal syntax checks by selecting it manually with ‘C-c ! s’
or ‘M-x flycheck-select-checker’.  If anything breaks, you can unselect
the syntax checker again with ‘C-u C-c ! s’ and fix the error without
further affecting Flycheck.

   Once you have confirmed that your new syntax checker works
flawlessly, you can make it available for automatic syntax checking by
registering it.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Registering new checkers,  Next: Parsing structured output,  Prev: Trying new checkers,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.4 Registering new syntax checkers
===================================

To register a new syntax checker for automatic syntax checking, just add
it to ‘flycheck-checkers’:

     (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'python-pylint)

   Flycheck will try all syntax checkers in this variable when checking
a buffer automatically, and check the buffer with the first syntax
checker in this list whose ‘:modes’ contains the current major mode.

   *Note*: Do _not_ use ‘flycheck-checker’ and ‘flycheck-select-checker’
to enable your own syntax checker in Flycheck extensions.  They are
reserved for _user customization_.

   Specifically, please do _not_ provide a hook function which selects
the syntax checker explicitly by assigning to ‘flycheck-checker’ or by
calling ‘flycheck-select-checker’.  In other words, this is *bad*:

     (defun enable-my-new-syntax-checker ()
       (setq flycheck-checker 'my-new-syntax-checker)
       (flycheck-buffer))

     (add-hook 'my-major-mode-hook #'enable-my-new-syntax-checker)

   This circumvents the entire automatic selection of Flycheck, and
prevents the user from effectively customizing Flycheck.

   Instead, just register your syntax checker in ‘flycheck-checkers’ and
let Flycheck automatically pick the best syntax checker.  In other
words, this is *good*:

     (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'my-new-syntax-checker)


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Parsing structured output,  Next: Passing configuration to checkers,  Prev: Registering new checkers,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.5 Parsing structured output
=============================

If your syntax checker tool offers some structured output format as
alternative to human-readable free text, you can use an ‘:error-parser’
function instead of writing an error pattern.  For instance, JSHint
(http://www.jshint.com/) offers the widely spread Checkstyle XML output
format which Flycheck supports out of the box:

     (flycheck-define-checker javascript-jshint
       "A JavaScript syntax and style checker using jshint.

     See URL `http://www.jshint.com'."
       :command ("jshint" "--checkstyle-reporter" source)
       :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle
       :modes (js-mode js2-mode js3-mode))

   As you can see, there are no patterns in this definition.  Instead
Flycheck calls the function ‘flycheck-parse-checkstyle’ to parse the
output.  This function parses the XML to extract the errors.  It’s
built-in into Flycheck, so if your tool supports Checkstyle XML, error
parsing comes _for free_ in Flycheck.  *Note Error parsers::, for more
information about error parsers.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Passing configuration to checkers,  Next: Controlling use of checkers,  Prev: Parsing structured output,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.6 Passing options and configuration files to syntax checkers
==============================================================

Many linting tools provide a rich set of options to configure their
analysis.  Flycheck makes it to define proper Emacs options and map them
to options of commands.

   For instance, the Rubocop (bbatsov/rubocop) tool checks Ruby for
semantic and stylistic issues.  Since style is mainly a matter of taste,
it has a special linting mode in which all stylistic checks are disabled
(error patterns omitted for readability):

     (flycheck-define-checker ruby-rubocop
       "A Ruby syntax and style checker using the RuboCop tool.

     See URL `http://batsov.com/rubocop/'."
       :command ("rubocop" "--format" "emacs"
                 (option-flag "--lint" flycheck-rubocop-lint-only)
                 source)
       :error-patterns ...
       :modes (ruby-mode))

   Note the special ‘option-flag’ argument, which splices the value of
the boolean Emacs option ‘flycheck-rubocop-lint-only’ into the command:
If the variable is non-nil, Flycheck adds the ‘--lint’ option to the
final command line, other Flycheck omits the entire argument.

   Flycheck also supports other special ‘option-’ arguments for plain
values or lists of values.  *Note Argument Substitution::, for a list of
all special arguments.

   Flycheck also provides a convenience macro ‘flycheck-def-option-var’
to declare these options:

     (flycheck-def-option-var flycheck-rubocop-lint-only nil ruby-rubocop
       "Whether to only report code issues in Rubocop.

     When non-nil, only report code issues in Rubocop, via `--lint'.
     Otherwise report style issues as well."
       :safe #'booleanp
       :type 'boolean)

   Essentially, this macro is just a wrapper around the built-in
‘defcustom’, which additionally keeps track of the syntax checker the
option belongs to, and adds the option to the appropriate custom group.
You can pass arbitrary custom keywords to this macro as we did in this
example: ‘:type’ marks this option as boolean flag, and ‘:safe’ allows
the use as file-local variable, if the value is boolean.  *Note Syntax
checker options::, for more information about syntax checker
configuration, and *note Checker configuration::, for the corresponding
API reference.

   By a similar mechanism you can also pass paths to configuration files
to a syntax checker tool.  The aforementioned Pylint
(http://www.pylint.org/) reads a configuration file for instance:

     (flycheck-define-checker python-pylint
       "A Python syntax and style checker using Pylint.

     This syntax checker requires Pylint 1.0 or newer.

     See URL `http://www.pylint.org/'."
       ;; -r n disables the scoring report
       :command ("pylint" "-r" "n"
                 "--msg-template" "{path}:{line}:{column}:{C}:{msg} ({msg_id})"
                 (config-file "--rcfile" flycheck-pylintrc)
                 source)
       :error-patterns ...
       :modes python-mode)

   The special ‘config-file’ argument passes a configuration file from
‘flycheck-pylintrc’ to ‘pylint’, if the value of the variable is
non-nil.

   Flycheck provides a sophisticated logic to find an appropriate
configuration file.  *Note Syntax checker configuration files::, for
more information about syntax checker configuration, and *note Checker
configuration::, for the corresponding API reference.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Controlling use of checkers,  Next: Applying multiple checkers,  Prev: Passing configuration to checkers,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.7 Controlling the use of a syntax checker
===========================================

If you need more control about when a syntax checker is used for syntax
checking, you can supply a custom ‘:predicate’ function.  Consider the
following syntax checker for Zsh scripts in Sh Mode:

     (flycheck-define-checker sh-zsh
       "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

     See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
       :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
       :error-patterns
       ((error line-start (file-name) ":" line ": " (message) line-end))
       :modes sh-mode
       :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh)))

   Sh Mode also supports Bash and other shells besides Zsh, so we
additionally provide a ‘:predicate’ that checks whether the current
buffer has the right shell.

   You can even omit ‘:modes’ and only use a predicate to determine
whether a syntax checker is applicable for the current buffer.


File: flycheck.info,  Node: Applying multiple checkers,  Prev: Controlling use of checkers,  Up: Syntax checker definitions

5.8 Applying multiple syntax checkers
=====================================

Frequently, we would like to use multiple syntax checkers in a buffer.
For instance, we might want to check the syntax of a script with
‘sh-zsh’ from the previous section, and then use Shellcheck
(koalaman/shellcheck/) to check for questionable code such as unquoted
variable expansions, if there are no syntax errors.  Flycheck supports
this scenario by _chaining_ syntax checkers.

   Suppose we defined a syntax checker for Shellcheck called
SH-SHELLCHECK as follows:

     (flycheck-define-checker sh-shellcheck
       "A shell script syntax and style checker using Shellcheck.

     See URL `https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/'."
       :command ("shellcheck" "-f" "checkstyle"
                 "-s" (eval (symbol-name sh-shell))
                 source)
       :modes sh-mode
       :error-parser flycheck-parse-checkstyle)

   Note how we use the special ‘eval’ argument to put the result of an
arbitrary Emacs Lisp expression into the command line of ‘shellcheck’,
in order to tell Shellcheck what shell the script is written for.

   We can now arrange for this syntax checker to be used after ‘sh-zsh’
with ‘flycheck-add-next-checker’:

     (flycheck-add-next-checker 'sh-zsh '(warning . sh-shellcheck))

   The first item of the cons cell in the second argument is the
_maximum error level_ in the buffer, for which ‘sh-shellcheck’ is still
applicable.  With ‘warning’ Flycheck will run ‘sh-shellcheck’ after
‘sh-zsh’ if there are ‘warning’ or ‘info’ level errors from ‘sh-zsh’,
but not if there are any errors with level ‘error’, such as syntax
errors.

   Flycheck will only use a chained syntax checker if it is registered
in ‘flycheck-checkers’, so we need to register our new syntax checker
(*note Registering new checkers::):

     (add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'sh-shellcheck 'append)

   Note that unlike before we _append_ the new syntax checker at the end
of ‘flycheck-checkers’.  This ensures that Flycheck does not try
‘sh-shellcheck’ _before_ ‘sh-zsh’.  Flycheck tries all syntax checkers
in this list in _order of appearance_, so if you add your new chained
syntax checker at the beginning, it will likely be used right away,
before any prior syntax checkers.

   You also can specify chained syntax checkers directly in
‘flycheck-define-checker’ with the ‘:next-checkers’ property.  Instead
of calling ‘flycheck-add-next-checker’, we could also have added this
property to the definition of ‘sh-zsh’:

     (flycheck-define-checker sh-zsh
       "A Zsh syntax checker using the Zsh shell.

     See URL `http://www.zsh.org/'."
       :command ("zsh" "-n" "-d" "-f" source)
       :error-patterns ...
       :modes sh-mode
       :predicate (lambda () (eq sh-shell 'zsh))
       :next-checkers ((warning . sh-shellcheck)))

   If you control the definition of both syntax checkers, this style is
_preferable_ to ‘flycheck-add-next-checker’.  Use the latter only if you
cannot change the definition of the prior syntax checker.

6 Flycheck hooks
****************

This chapter gives you a brief overview over Flycheck’s rich hook
interface, which you can use for your own extensions.

6.1 Status changes
==================

‘flycheck-before-syntax-check-hook’ and
‘flycheck-after-syntax-check-hook’ run before and after syntax checks,
and let you update your Emacs instance according to Flycheck’s state.
For instance, flycheck-color-mode-line
(https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-color-mode-line) uses these hooks
to colour your mode-line according to the result of the last syntax
check.  Additionally, ‘flycheck-status-changed-functions’ runs on every
single status change of Flycheck, and provides a fine-grained reporting
about what Flycheck is currently doing.

6.2 Error processing
====================

The functions in ‘flycheck-process-error-functions’ are used to process
new errors reported by a Flycheck syntax checker.  Add to this hook to
get informed about each error reported in a Flycheck buffer.  In fact,
Flycheck uses this hook itself: The standard value
‘flycheck-add-overlay’ is responsible for adding error highlighting to
the buffer.  As a consequence, you can _entirely opt out_ from
highlighting with a custom hook.

6.3 Error display
=================

The function ‘flycheck-display-errors-function’ is called to display an
error at point.  The flycheck-pos-tip
(https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-pos-tip) extension uses this hook
to show errors in a GUI popup like conventional IDEs do.

Appendix A Supported languages
******************************

This chapter lists the languages supported by Flycheck.  Some 3rd party
extensions add support for more languages:

   • flycheck-ledger (https://github.com/flycheck-ledger) adds a syntax
     checker for files of the Ledger (http://ledger-cli.org/) accounting
     tool.
   • flycheck-mercury (https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-mercury)
     adds a syntax checker for the Mercury (http://mercurylang.org/)
     programming language.
   • flycheck-ocaml (https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-ocaml) adds a
     syntax checker for the OCaml programming language, using the Merlin
     (https://github.com/the-lambda-church/merlin) tool.

   Each language has one or more syntax checkers, whose names follow a
convention of ‘LANGUAGE-TOOL’ where LANGUAGE is the programming language
checked by the checker, and TOOL the name of the checker tool.

   The syntax checkers are listed in the order they are applied to a
buffer.  Use ‘C-c ! ?’ (‘flycheck-describe-checker’) to obtain more
information about a syntax checker.

Appendix C GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
