;;; Commentary:

;; Flycheck defines a `flycheck-clang-include-path' variable that it
;; searches for headers when checking C/C++ code.
;;
;; This package provides a convenient way of adding libraries to that
;; list, using pkg-config and completion.

;;; Code:

(require 's)
(require 'dash)
(require 'flycheck)

(defvar flycheck-pkg-config--libs nil)

(defun flycheck-pkg-config--ignore-case-less-p (s1 s2)
  (string< (downcase s1) (downcase s2)))

;;;###autoload
(defun flycheck-pkg-config ()
  "Configure flycheck to use additional includes
when checking the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  ;; Find out all the libraries installed on this system.
  (unless flycheck-pkg-config--libs
    (let* ((all-libs-with-names
            (shell-command-to-string "pkg-config --list-all"))
           (lines (s-split "\n" (s-trim all-libs-with-names)))
           (libs (--map (-first-item (s-split " " it)) lines)))
      (setq flycheck-pkg-config--libs (-sort #'flycheck-pkg-config--ignore-case-less-p libs))))

         (lib-name (completing-read "Library name: " flycheck-pkg-config--libs))
         ;; Find the include flags, e.g. "-I/usr/lib/foo"
         (pkgconfig-cmd (format "pkg-config --cflags %s" lib-name))
