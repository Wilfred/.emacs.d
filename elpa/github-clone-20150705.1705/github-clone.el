;;; Commentary:

;; `github-clone' will automatically clone a repo to a specified directory, and
;; then optionally fork the repo and add a remote named after the github user to
;; the fork.

;;; Change Log:

;;  0.2 2014-10-06 Switch to hub style cloning; always clone as origin, and
;;                 optionally add a remote to user's fork named after their
;;                 username. Removes support for 'upstream' style.

;;; Todo:

;; Use `github-clone-remotes' to add named remotes easily for repositories in
;; the same network.

;;; Code:
