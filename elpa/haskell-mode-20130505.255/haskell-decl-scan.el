;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; Top-level declarations are scanned and placed in a menu.  Supports
;; full Latin1 Haskell 1.4 as well as literate scripts.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;; 
;; To turn declaration scanning on for all Haskell buffers under the
;; Haskell mode of Moss&Thorn, add this to .emacs:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-decl-scan)
;;
;; Otherwise, call `turn-on-haskell-decl-scan'.
;;
;;
;; Customisation:
;;
;; None available so far.
;;
;;
;; History:
;;
;; If you have any problems or suggestions, after consulting the list
;; below, email gem@cs.york.ac.uk quoting the version of the library
;; you are using, the version of Emacs you are using, and a small
;; example of the problem or suggestion.  Note that this library
;; requires a reasonably recent version of Emacs.
;;
;; Uses `imenu' under Emacs, and `func-menu' under XEmacs.
;;
;; Version 1.2:
;;   Added support for LaTeX-style literate scripts.
;;
;; Version 1.1:
;;   Use own syntax table.  Fixed bug for very small buffers.  Use
;;   markers instead of pointers (markers move with the text).
;;
;; Version 1.0:
;;   Brought over from Haskell mode v1.1.
;;
;;
;; Present Limitations/Future Work (contributions are most welcome!):
;;
;; . Declarations requiring information extending beyond starting line
;;   don't get scanned properly, eg.
;;   > class Eq a =>
;;   >       Test a
;;
;; . Comments placed in the midst of the first few lexemes of a
;;   declaration will cause havoc, eg.
;;   > infixWithComments :: Int -> Int -> Int
;;   > x {-nastyComment-} `infixWithComments` y = x + y
;;   but are not worth worrying about.
;;
;; . Would be nice to scan other top-level declarations such as
;;   methods of a class, datatype field labels...  any more?
;;
;; . Support for GreenCard?
;;
;; . Re-running (literate-)haskell-imenu should not cause the problems
;;   that it does.  The ability to turn off scanning would also be
;;   useful.  (Note that re-running (literate-)haskell-mode seems to
;;   cause no problems.)
;;
;; . Inconsistency: we define the start of a declaration in `imenu' as
;;   the start of the line the declaration starts on, but in
;;   `func-menu' as the start of the name that the declaration is
;;   given (eg. "class Eq a => Ord a ..." starts at "class" in `imenu'
;;   but at "Ord" in `func-menu').  This avoids rescanning of the
;;   buffer by the goto functions of `func-menu' but allows `imenu' to
;;   have the better definition of the start of the declaration (IMO).
;;
;; . `func-menu' cannot cope well with spaces in declaration names.
;;   This is unavoidable in "instance Eq Int" (changing the spaces to
;;   underscores would cause rescans of the buffer).  Note though that
;;   `fume-prompt-function-goto' (usually bound to "C-c g") does cope
;;   with spaces okay.
;;
;; . Would like to extend the goto functions given by `func-menu'
;;   under XEmacs to Emacs.  Would have to implement these
;;   ourselves as `imenu' does not provide them.
;;
;; . `func-menu' uses its own syntax table when grabbing a declaration
;;   name to lookup (why doesn't it use the syntax table of the
;;   buffer?) so some declaration names will not be grabbed correctly,
;;   eg. "fib'" will be grabbed as "fib" since "'" is not a word or
;;   symbol constituent under the syntax table `func-menu' uses.

;; All functions/variables start with
;; `(turn-(on/off)-)haskell-decl-scan' or `haskell-ds-'.

;; The imenu support is based on code taken from `hugs-mode',
;; thanks go to Chris Van Humbeeck.

  "Minor mode for declaration scanning for Haskell mode.
Top-level declarations are scanned and listed in the menu item \"Declarations\".
Selecting an item from this menu will take point to the start of the
declaration.

\\[haskell-ds-forward-decl] and \\[haskell-ds-backward-decl] move forward and backward to the start of a declaration.

Under XEmacs, the following keys are also defined:

\\[fume-list-functions] lists the declarations of the current buffer,
\\[fume-prompt-function-goto] prompts for a declaration to move to, and
\\[fume-mouse-function-goto] moves to the declaration whose name is at point.

This may link with `haskell-doc' (only for Emacs currently).

For non-literate and LaTeX-style literate scripts, we assume the
common convention that top-level declarations start at the first
column.  For Bird-style literate scripts, we assume the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the third column,
ie. after \"> \".

Anything in `font-lock-comment-face' is not considered for a
declaration.  Therefore, using Haskell font locking with comments
coloured in `font-lock-comment-face' improves declaration scanning.

To turn on declaration scanning for all Haskell buffers, add this to
.emacs:

  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-decl-scan)

To turn declaration scanning on for the current buffer, call
`turn-on-haskell-decl-scan'.

Literate Haskell scripts are supported: If the value of
`haskell-literate' (automatically set by the Haskell mode of
Moss&Thorn) is `bird', a Bird-style literate script is assumed.  If it
is nil or `tex', a non-literate or LaTeX-style literate script is
assumed, respectively.
