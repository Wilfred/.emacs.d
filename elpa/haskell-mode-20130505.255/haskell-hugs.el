;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To send a Haskell buffer to another buffer running a Hugs interpreter
;; The functions are adapted from  the Hugs Mode developed by
;;         Chris Van Humbeeck <chris.vanhumbeeck@cs.kuleuven.ac.be>
;; which used to be available at:
;; http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/Forschung/FP/Haskell/hugs-mode.el
;;
;; Installation:
;; 
;; To use with the Haskell mode of 
;;        Moss&Thorn <http://www.haskell.org/haskell-mode>
;; add this to .emacs:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-hugs)
;;
;; Customisation:
;;       The name of the hugs interpreter is in variable
;;          haskell-hugs-program-name
;;       Arguments can be sent to the Hugs interpreter when it is called
;;       by setting the value of the variable
;;          haskell-hugs-program-args
;;       which by default contains '("+.") so that the progress of the
;;       interpreter is visible without any "^H" in the *hugs* Emacs buffer.
;;
;;       This value can be interactively by calling C-cC-s with an
;;       argument. 
;;
;;       If the command does not seem to respond, see the
;;          content of the `comint-prompt-regexp' variable
;;          to check that it waits for the appropriate Hugs prompt
;;          the current value is appropriate for Hugs 1.3 and 1.4
;;
;;
;;    `haskell-hugs-hook' is invoked in the *hugs* once it is started.
;;    
;;; All functions/variables start with
;;; `(turn-(on/off)-)haskell-hugs' or `haskell-hugs-'.
