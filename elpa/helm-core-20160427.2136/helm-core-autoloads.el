In KEYMAP, define key sequence KEY for function list FUNCTIONS.
Each function runs sequentially for each KEY press. 
If DELAY is specified, switch back to initial function of FUNCTIONS list
after DELAY seconds.
The functions in FUNCTIONS list take no args.
e.g
  (defun foo ()
    (message \"Run foo\"))
  (defun bar ()
    (message \"Run bar\"))
  (defun baz ()
    (message \"Run baz\"))

\(helm-define-multi-key global-map \"<f5> q\" '(foo bar baz) 2)

Each time \"<f5> q\" is pressed, the next function is executed. Waiting 
more than 2 seconds between key presses switches back to executing the first 
function on the next hit.

(autoload 'helm-define-key-with-subkeys "helm" "\
Defines in MAP a KEY and SUBKEY to COMMAND.

This allows typing KEY to call COMMAND the first time and
type only SUBKEY on subsequent calls.

Arg MAP is the keymap to use, SUBKEY is the initial short key-binding to
call COMMAND.

Arg OTHER-SUBKEYS is an alist specifying other short key-bindings
to use once started.
e.g:

\(helm-define-key-with-subkeys global-map
   (kbd \"C-x v n\") ?n 'git-gutter:next-hunk '((?p . git-gutter:previous-hunk)))


In this example, `C-x v n' will run `git-gutter:next-hunk'
subsequent \"n\"'s run this command again
and subsequent \"p\"'s run `git-gutter:previous-hunk'.

Arg MENU is a string displayed in minibuffer that 
describes SUBKEY and OTHER-SUBKEYS.
Arg EXIT-FN specifies a function to run on exit.

For any other keys pressed, run their assigned command as defined
in MAP and then exit the loop running EXIT-FN, if specified.

NOTE: SUBKEY and OTHER-SUBKEYS bindings support char syntax only 
\(e.g ?n), so don't use strings or vectors to define them.

(autoload 'helm "helm" "\
Main function to execute helm sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect
:buffer :keymap :default :history :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see below.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume
            preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

A list of sources used for this session.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of a helm source
i.e (a symbol can be passed instead of a list of sources).
It also accepts an alist representing a helm source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES).
NOTE: In this case the source is embedded in the helm command and
have no symbol name, so it is not reachable from outside.
It will be referenced in `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

:input

Temporary value of `helm-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `helm'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

:buffer

`helm-buffer' instead of *helm*.

:keymap

`helm-map' for current `helm' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]. When nil or not
present `thing-at-point' will be used instead. If
`helm--maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-`nil' display will be
updated using :default arg as input unless :input is specified,
which in this case will take precedence over :default. This is a
string or a list. If list, car of the list becomes initial
default input. \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element]
cycles through the list items.

:history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.
When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. The HISTORY element should be a valid symbol.

:allow-nest

Allow running this helm command in a running helm session.

Standard arguments are supported. These two are the same:

\(helm :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
       :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
       :history history)

and

\(helm sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

are the same for now. However, the use of non-keyword args is
deprecated and should not be used.

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

\(helm :sources 'helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

starts helm session with `helm-source-buffers' source in
*helm buffers* buffer and sets variable `helm-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as a session local variable.
