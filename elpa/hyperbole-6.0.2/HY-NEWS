			  What's New in GNU Hyperbole
				 by Bob Weiner

	   (See "ChangeLog" for more complete details of changes.)

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.2
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - pathname Implicit Button Type: generalized to handle hash-style links to
      HTML files, to Github Markdown # sections and to Emacs outline *
      sections.  So an Action Key press on any of the following links displays
      the link referent:
            "man/hyperbole.html#Questions-and-Answers"
	    "README.md#why-was-hyperbole-developed"
	    "DEMO#HTML Markdown and Emacs Outline Hash Links"
      Even links split across 2 lines like this now work: "DEMO#Social Media
      Hashtags and Usernames", as long as point is on the first line.

      Within HTML and Markdown files, in-file hash links without any file name
      prefix work as well.

      HTML hash-links are case-sensitive; other hash-links are not.  Hash links
      typically use dashes in place of the spaces that referents may contain,
      but if the link is enclosed in quotes, Hyperbole allows spaces to be used
      as well.  In fact, it is best practice to always enclose hash-style links
      in quotes so Hyperbole can distinguish them from other similar looking
      constructs, such as social media hashtags (see "(hyperbole)Social Media").

      Pathnames surrounded by literal non-ASCII quote marks now work as well.
      For example, ‘http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/’.

    - New Implicit Button Type, markdown-internal-link, displays any in-file
      Markdown link referent, aside from pathnames and urls.  Together with
      other types, all Markdown links can now be followed by the Action Key.

    - social-reference Implicit Button Type: Disabled this type within quoted
      strings (all modes) and within parentheses (markdown-mode), so in-file
      hash link references are not matched as social hash tags.  Made the list
      of modes a variable, hibtypes-social-inhibit-modes.

    - New link-to-web-search Action Type: Allows global and explicit buttons
      to link to specific web term searches from `hyperbole-web-search-alist'.

    - org-mode Implicit Button Type: Improved to invoke org-meta-return when
      not on an Org link or outline heading.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added pointer to HyControl video and {C-c \} binding which invokes
      HyControl window control.

    - README File: New Org-mode user testimonial.

    - DEMO File: Added description and exercise using the new Find/Web menu.

    - Added README.md.html introduction with images combining README, INSTALL
      and HY-ABOUT information.

    - Full set of hand-written changes are now in the file "Changes".  The
      former name, ChangeLog, is now auto-generated from the version controlled
      'git log' but not as complete.

  KEYS

    - New variables, action-key-eol-function and assist-key-eol-function, used
      to control what the Action and Assist Keys do at the end of a line.
      Default behaviors remain as before but now one can set these to do
      something other than scrolling, if desired.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Smart Scrolling"

    - When in HyControl, pressing {ESC} now quits in addition to {q}.

  MENUS

    - New submenu, Find/Web, for quick access to major web search engines.
      The Find/Web menu looks like this:
        Web> Amazon Bing Dictionary Elisp Facebook Google Hub(git) Images Maps RFCs StackOverflow Twitter Wikipedia Youtube

      Hyperbole binds the key {C-c /} for quick access to this menu, if it is
      not already bound prior to Hyperbole's initialization. The
      Cust/Web-Search menu, {C-h h c w}, sets the option,
      hyperbole-web-search-browser-function, which determines whether web
      search results are displayed within Emacs or with an external web
      browser.  A short video introduction to the Find/Web menu may be found at
      https://youtu.be/8lMlJed0-OM.

      Advanced users can change the search engines listed in the Find/Web menu
      with M-x customize-variable RET hyperbole-web-search-alist RET.  Changes
      are automatically reflected in the Hyperbole menus once applied.
      Remember each search engine name must begin with a unique letter and each
      URL must have a %s format field indicating where to place the web search
      term when a search is performed.  See "(hyperbole)Web Search Engines".

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.1
===========================================================================

NOTE: Version 6.0.1 is the first public release by the author since version
4.18.  All version 5 releases were test releases, so all V5 and V6 features
are new in 2016 and you should look through them all.

  BUTTONS

    - New Implicit Button Type, social-reference: for social media hashtag or
      username references, social-reference.  Action key activation
      displays the web page associated with the hashtag or username.
      References can look like #hashtag or @username for Twitter
      references.  fb#hashtag or facebook@username for Facebook references
      or in#hashtag or instagram@username for Instagram references.  See
      the new file "hib-social.el" for more information.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - The introductory parts of the manual have been improved and the flow
      from section to section is better.  Added menu key sequences to
      "(hyperbole)Suggestion or Bug Reporting".  Expanded and added
      instructions on using the customize interface to change the functions
      run by Smart Key modeline clicks.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modeline".

  VARIABLES

    - hsettings.el is now included in the Hyperbole package rather than
      generated (formerly called hsite.el).  Use the Hyperbole customization
      variables to change anything in there rather than editing the file
      manually as before.

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.0
===========================================================================

  HYROLO

    - The Hyperbole contact manager has been renamed to HyRolo and all of its
      identifiers now begin with hyrolo-.  If you had a custom value of
      `rolo-file-list' in your ~/.emacs file, you should rename it to
      `hyrolo-file-list'.

  KEYS

    - Removed the {RET} key bindings of the Action Key in read-only modes since
      it was not consistent across all modes and probably was little used.  It
      also could interfere with mode-specific usage of this key.  Just use the
      standard Action Key bindings.

  MAIL

    - Implicit mail address buttons are recognized in many more programming
      modes.  See the value of `mail-address-mode-list'.

  VARIABLES

    - Hyperbole is now integrated with the Emacs option customization system,
      allowing for interactive editing and permanent setting of many Hyperbole
      options.  Use {M-x customize-browse RET} and find the Hyperbole group
      under Applications.  Hyperbole's options are divided into logical
      subgroups such as Rolo and Koutliner.  See "(emacs)Easy Customization"
      for details on the customization system and "(hyperbole)Customization"
      for Hyperbole specifics.

    - Renamed any Hyperbole hook variables that had a colon in their names
      to use a hyphen instead.

  WINDOW CONFIGURATIONS

    - Similarly, the commands from the Win/ menu from Wconfig have been
      renamed to begin with hywconfig- and the library is now called
      hywconfig.el.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.15
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - New Implicit Button Type, debbugs-gnu-mode: When on a GNU Debbugs listing
      entry in debbugs-gnu-mode, an Action Key press displays the discussion of
      the selected issue; an Assist Key press pretty prints the status of the
      issue to a window below the listing window.  This augments the
      debbugs-gnu-query implicit button type from V5.14 which recognizes
      bug/issue ids and queries in any buffer.

    - Initial Org Mode Support: The new implicit button type, org-mode, follows
      Org mode hyperlinks and cycles display views of Org mode outline headings.
      When on a heading, the Action Key cycles the view of the subtree at point
      and the Assist Key cycles the view of all headings in the buffer.

      Suggest other good ideas for Smart Key actions on Org entities and we'll
      likely implement them.

    - Links to Info Manual Index Items: You can now drag between windows with
      the Action Mouse Key depressed to an Info Manual index menu entry to
      create an explicit button link to it (or use {C-h h e c} with an action
      type of link-to-Info-index-item).  Then the button will always take you
      to the line in the manual referenced by that index item.  This also works
      with other Info menu items and cross-references.  Implicit buttons that
      reference index items work too, like "(hyperbole)C-c C-m"!  And when you
      are creating the link, full completion of the file name (within
      parentheses) and the index item name is provided; just type ? to list
      completions after typing a few characters.  Since Emacs and most GNU
      programs include Info manuals, you now ​have ​a simple way to link to and
​      ​jump​ ​to any marked item within any manual.
      
      Previously, when creating a link to an Info manual node, Hyperbole
      would ignore cross-references and menu items and just link directly
      to the node rather than anything it referenced.  To get that behavior
      now, simply link to a place in the node that does not reference another
      place.

    - Link Button Creation: Hyperbole now shows you what you linked to at
      global or explicit link button creation time.  Previously, it showed you
      only the type of the link.  So if you drag across windows from a button
      label to an Info index item now, you will know that the link goes to the
      index item entry and not to the index node containing the item reference.

    - New Implicit Button Type, pathname-line-and-column: A whitespace or quote
      delimited existing pathname followed by a :line-num and an optional
      :column-num displays the path at line-num and column-num.  So
      "~/.emacs:10:40" shows your Emacs initialization file at line 10 and
      column 40.  The column number is optional.​

    - GNU Info Manual Key Sequences: Previously, Hyperbole recognized​ ​key
      sequences delimited by curly braces only, {}.  Now it recognizes​ the​
      ​quotation ​marks used in GNU Info manuals as well and can execute them
      with an Action Key press within Info buffers.

    - Imenu Item Recognition: When the Emacs imenu library is in use and an
      identifier menu has been generated for the current buffer, an Action Key
      press on an identifier at point jumps to the identifier definition
      within the current buffer; an Assist Key press prompts with completion
      for an identifier defined within the buffer and then jumps to its
      definition.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Smart Key Debugging: Added a section, "(hyperbole)Smart Key Debugging",
      to the Hyperbole Manual, documenting the usage of the Customize Menu
      option, Toggle-Smart-Key-Debug (minibuffer menu Cust/Debug-Toggle,
      {C-h h c d}).

  KEYS

    - Toggle Hyperbole Keys: The new command, {M-x hyperbole-toggle-bindings
      RET}, toggles Hyperbole mouse and keyboard keys off and on.  This is not
      bound to a key because it will make Hyperbole unusable until the keys are
      re-established with another toggle.  This forces you to know what you are
      doing before you utilize this feature.

  MENUS

    - Minibuffer Keyboard Direct Selection:  You have always been able to click
      with your mouse on a minibuffer menu item to directly select it.  Now
      Hyperbole has the keys {TAB} or {M-f} to move to the next menu item and
      {Shift-TAB}, {M-TAB} or {M-b} to move to the previous item, with each
      cycling back when it reaches the end or beginning of the menu.  The
      fastest way to select minibuffer menu items from the keyboard remains
      typing the first letter (case-insensitive) of the menu item.

    - Minibuffer Menu Navigation Changes: A press of {RET} with point at the
      end of a menu, quits from the menu.  {RET} with point in a menu prefix
      (before the '>' character), returns to the top-level Hyperbole menu.
      Clicks of the Action Mouse Key do the same thing, so now you can
      navigate and quit from menus with just the Action Mouse Key.

===========================================================================
*  			        V5.13 and V5.14
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Instant Bug Lookups and Queries: New Gnu Debbugs bug/issue tracking
      implicit button type, debbugs-gnu-query, that jumps to the description
      and discussion of issues by issue number and displays an issue's status.
      This works for the GNU Hyperbole issue tracker as well as many other GNU
      projects.  All of these button formats may be embedded within any text:

	     #id-number
	     bug#id-number, bug# id-number, bug #id-number or bug id-number
	     bug?attr1=val1&attr2=val2&attr3=val3
	     bug#id-number?attr1=val1&attr2=val2&attr3=val3

      Note that `issue' or `debbugs' may be used in place of `bug'.

      See the documentation at the start of "hib-debbugs.el" for more
      information.

    - During the creation of link-to-Info-node explicit buttons with an
      argument of the type (filename)nodename, full completion is offered for
      both the filename and the node name; just type ? to list completions
      after typing a few characters.  You now can drop the .info suffix from
      filenames as well, so "(hyperbole)Smart Keys" works fine as a node
      reference.

    - Implicit links from the output of the UNIX apropos command now work
      properly in Emacs 25.

    - Implicit pathname matches now handle compressed Emacs Lisp files found
      anywhere within the directories of `load-path' and do not try to expand
      paths that begin with a ~.

    - New variable, `hpath:info-suffix', is a regular expression of Info
      filename suffixes which may be ommitted when using parenthesized Info
      filenames in links; this allows for compressed Info file matches and Info
      pathnames of the form "(Hyperbole)" to work.  That displays the top node
      of the Hyperbole Manual in the Info browser.

    - Pathnames ending in .mp3, .wav or .ogg are played as music files rather
      than displayed if your Emacs has support for this.  Modify the value of
      the variable, `hpath:internal-display-alist' to add more formats.

    - New per-window system association list variables determine what if any
      file types within Hyperbole hyperlinks are displayed by external programs
      outside of Emacs.  See the values of and documentation for:
      `hpath:external-display-alist-macos', `hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows',
      and `hpath:external-display-alist-x'.

    - Added support for &, ~, and ^ as identifier characters in Lisp tags and
      removed #.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - DEMO File: Major updates to reflect the latest Hyperbole features.  Added
      sections on HyControl, Creating and Modifying Explicit Buttons and
      Path Suffixes and Variables.  Try it out with {C-h h d d}.

    - Hyperbole Manual
        - Updated all screenshots in the manual; thanks to Mats L.
        - In the "(hyperbole)Internal Viewers" section, added a description of
          the file formats supported by the default setting of the
          `hpath:internal-display-alist' variable.
        - Added sections "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modifiers" and
	  "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modeline".
        - Added a "(hyperbole)Glossary" entry for Chord Keyboard.
        - In "(hyperbole)Smart Key Thing Selection", added documentation of the
          {C-c RET} key for syntactical region marking and the {C-c .} key for
          delimited thing jumping between start and end.
        - In the Cust/ menu section of "(hyperbole)Menus" which lists all
	  Hyperbole key bindings, indicated which keys are bound only if not
	  bound prior to loading Hyperbole.

  HYCONTROL

    - Frame placement calculations now account for window system decorations
      around frame, leading to improved placement offsets around screen edges.
      See the documentation for `hycontrol-set-screen-offsets'.

  MENUS

    - On the Hyperbole menubar menu, the Types submenu which shows
      documentation for Hyperbole types has been moved below the Documentation
      menu to match the Hyperbole minibuffer menu location.  Also added a Types
      menu item under the Explicit-Button menu to match the one under the
      Implicit-Button menu.

    - On the Hyperbole Customize/Change-Key-Bindings menubar menu, renamed
      these entries and added Mark-Think-Key.  Similar updates done to the
      minibuffer menu.

  MOUSE AND SMART KEY SUPPORT

    - An Action Key press on a Hyperbole minibuffer menu key sequence now
      invokes the associated menu action.  Try it with {C-h h d g} to see the
      Hyperbole glossary.  An Assist Key press shows help for the menu item.

    - Changed the `assist-key-default-function' which applies in an unrecognized
      context to trigger an error by default to match the behavior of the
      Action Key.  Its prior value, toggle display of or hide the Smart Key
      summary, is performed by an Assist Key click in the right of a modeline
      or via minibuffer menu with {C-h h d s}.

    - Point is now left within the Smart Key summary by default and it is in
      help mode so you can page through it with SPC and DEL keys and then quit
      from it with {q}.

    - A click of the Action Mouse Key within an inactive minibuffer menu
      displays the Hyperbole minibuffer menu, allowing you to invoke menu
      entries with the mouse.  A click of the Assist Key in the same place
      displays the buffer, window and frame jump menu just as does a click
      within the middle of a modeline since it is easy to miss by a little and
      click on one or the other.  These behaviors are controlled by the new
      variables, `action-key-minibuffer-function' and
      `assist-key-minibuffer-function'.

    - Distributed Window System Support: Previously, Hyperbole supported mouse
      control only on the screen on which it was launched.  If you used
      emacsclient or other means to create a frame on another screen or outside
      of a terminal, that frame would not have Hyperbole mouse support even
      though it was under a window system.  Now each frame receives mouse
      support whenever its window system has mouse support.

    - Improved support for using the Action and Assist Mouse Keys as Control-
      and Meta- modifier keys, mainly for use with a chord keyboard or to
      balance hand use to reduce carpal tunnel stress.  Made `hmouse-mod-mode'
      a regular minor mode.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modifiers" for more
      details.

  ROLO

    - Fixed entry sorting to work with Emacs 25.


===========================================================================
*				    V5.12
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Prevented keyword matches as identifiers in Java, C++, C, Objective-C
      and Python. 

    - Prevented @ annotation matches when matching to Java identifiers/tags.

    - In Info documentation browsing mode, added support for index nodes and
      for fixed header line and text-property-based breadcrumb header lines
      now used in Emacs, so the Action Key can now follow links associated
      with all of these entities.

    - In compilation buffers, e.g. {M-x make RET}, if an error line has a
      relative pathname which Hyperbole cannot resolve, it will prompt
      for the directory in which to resolve the path.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added printable hyperbole.pdf version of the Hyperbole Manual.

    - DEMO file: Updated horizontal and vertical drag exercises to
      correspond to current Hyperbole behavior.

    - Added chapter on HyControl, window, frame and buffer control.

    - In the Hyperbole Manual Glossary, added Buffer, Frame, HyControl
      and Window definitions. 

    - Added additional Q&A in an appendix.

    - Clarified and fixed Smart Key modeline behavior documentation.

    - Made example text larger for easier reading.

    - Added Screen definition to the Glossary.

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Hyperbole now includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
      management system available; we call it HyControl.  If you use a lot of
      Emacs windows or frames (typically, window system windows), this is for
      you.  HyControl lets you interactively adjust the current layout of your
      windows and frames down to the pixel-level if desired.  You keep
      adjusting the location, size and display elements of your windows and
      frames until they look as you like and then you simply quit HyControl and
      go back to work.

    - Expanded Hyperbole menu of buffers by major mode to allow for
      `hui-menu-max-list-length' number of buffers, by default, 24.

    - Made a right to left horizontal drag from near a right-side window divider
      properly shrink the window width under Emacs 25.

  KEYS

    - The Hyperbole Screen submenu provides access to HyControl as well as the
      key binding {C-c \}.

    - Removed {C-c C-t} hmouse-toggle-bindings key binding.  This
      should be used rarely, so force use of {M-x hmouse-toggle-bindings RET). 

    - Updated "hmouse-mod.el" library for Emacs 25; it allows using the Smart
      Mouse Keys as Control and Meta modifiers when desired.

  KOUTLINER

    - Improved recognition of Klinks, preventing false matches.

    - Added missing {C-c C-i}/{C-c TAB} binding mentioned in the EXAMPLE.kotl
      file; sets cell attributes.

    - {C=t} Transpose characters - Added error checks at the beginning of cells
      and end of lines for times when there are not 2 chars to transpose.

  ROLO
  
    - Improved {M-s} interactive string searching for rolo match buffer strings.
      Made {C-u M-s} to a regexp search for rolo match buffer strings.

    - Documented the {l} hyrolo-locate command in the Hyperbole manual.

    - The format of the rolo entry date added to new entries is now configurable
      via the variable, `hyrolo-date-format'.  It uses the formatting
      strings listed in the documentation of the function `format-time-string'.

    - All rolo find and search commands are now case-insensitive.

    - Using a numeric prefix argument with rolo find commands now
      properly limits the number of matches to a maximum of that number.

    - If the Big Brother Database (BBDB) is loaded before the rolo, its
      `bbdb-file' is added to the list of files searched by the rolo.
      You can manually added this file to `hyrolo-file-list' as well and
      its format will automatically be handled by the rolo.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.11
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Improved support for remote pathname access (outside local
      filesystems).

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Much faster and better lookup of active Emacs Lisp identifiers
      when the Action Key is pressed over one.  Face definitions are
      also found now.  TAGS files are used only if the identifier has
      not been loaded within the current Emacs session.

  KOUTLINER

    - Proper support for isearch temporary display of invisible text
      when it contains a search match.  {C-s}, interactive search,
      expands and contracts text dynamically to show any search
      results, just as it does in the regular Emacs outline mode.  You
      can toggle whether such searches include invisible/hidden text
      (the default) or not.  Use the
      Customize/Toggle-Isearch-Invisible-Text menubar item or the
      Cust/Isearch-Invisible minibuffer menu item to toggle this
      setting.

  MAIL AND NEWS READERS

    - New variable, `inhibit-hyperbole-messaging' with default value
      of t inhibits Hyperbole's support for explicit buttons within
      mail and news buffers.  When t, Hyperbole will not alter
      messaging mode hooks nor overload functions from these packages,
      preventing potential incompatibilities.

      If you want to use Hyperbole buttons in mail and news buffers,
      use the new Customize/Toggle-Messaging-Explicit-Buttons menubar
      item or the minibuffer menu Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts item.  These
      not only change the variable value but also add or remove the
      setup hooks as necessary.

  ROLO
  
    - New {o} key binding for an overview of all Rolo matches at all
      levels, one line per entry.

    - {t} top-level cells command works in all cases now.

    - {Shift-TAB} added as an additional key to move backwards one
      Rolo match.

    - Improved operation of {l} and {M-s C-s} commands that search for
      occurrences of match strings and allow extending the search term.

    - Support for looking up contacts in the Big Brother Database
      (BBDB) file of email addresses, when that package is used.
      The functions, hyrolo-grep-bbdb finds regular expression matches
      and hyrolo-fgrep-bbdb finds string matches.  All regular Rolo
      match buffer commands may then be applied. The {e} command for
      editing an entry signals an error when applied to the BBDB file,
      however.

  SMART KEYS

    - The Assist Key when pressed in the middle portion of a modeline
      now pops up a very useful menu of display-oriented commands.
      Jump to buffers categorized by major mode, to windows by buffer
      name, or to frames by name.  Manage your windows and frames
      quickly with this menu as well.  Another can't live without
      feature.  This comes from the new file, hui-jmenu.el.

    - Added Python etags support for jumping to Python definitions.
      With the separate OO-Browser package, definition location is
      much better than just with etags.
      See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Python Source Code" for help.

    - The Hyperbole Manual Smart Key Reference appendix now has a
      subsection for each context, allowing quick reference of a
      particular Smart Key context.  Also, added documentation for
      delimited thing selection, copying and moving.

    - New function, hyperbole-popup-menu, to display the Hyperbole
      menubar menu at the mouse point (or the left of the menubar when
      running on a dumb terminal).  This is useful as a setting
      of `action-key-default-function' if you want some undefined
      Action Key context to popup this menu in order to use Hyperbole
      commands.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.10
===========================================================================

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Hyperbole now downloads, builds and installs as a regular
      Emacs package (but from a special archive location while pre-testing).

    - Automatic time-zone handling under MS Windows (already existed
      for UNIX-like operating systems).  Plus support for 3 mouse
      buttons under Windows.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - Updated the extended find-file commands which handle http (www) and ftp
      URLs to support the Tramp library included with newer versions of Emacs.
      Use the menu item Hyperbole/Customization/Find-File-Accepts-URLs to
      enable or to disable this.  See "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File"
      for details.

  KOUTLINER

    - Editing commands that normally delete/replace an active region
      now do this in the Koutline.  If a region extends beyond one
      cell, an error is triggered or if `kotl-mode:shrink-region-flag'
      is set to t, the Koutliner automatically shrinks the region to
      the first cell within the region and then continues the editing
      operation.

    - Updated yanking and other editing commands for improved
      compatibility with Emacs 25.

    - Internal improvements to many tree handling, filling and view
      changing commands.

    - New Shift-TAB key binding to demote trees (shift them up a
      level), for compatibility with other outliners.

  MENUS

    - The new Find/Locate-Files menu item (minibuffer menu
      Find/LocateFiles) prompts for a pattern and displays a list of
      all matching pathnames found throughout the file system.  On Mac
      OS X, this uses Spotlight (the mdfind command); on UNIX, it uses
      the `locate' command.  Within the result *Locate* buffer, you
      can then use the Find/Grep-Files menu item to find matching
      lines within only these paths (files and directories).

  SMART KEYS

    - Action Key now ignores JavaScript keywords when searching for
      identifiers to match.

    - Commands that interactively prompt for a Koutline cell label now
      offer completion and require a match to a visible outline cell.
      This helps prevent operating on an invisible cell unintentionally.

  THING SELECTION

    - Selection of open/close matched tag pairs and jumping between
      them now works in web-mode, which supports multiple web
      languages within one file (previously only html-mode was
      supported).  Also, can now select chained identifiers like:
      parent.child.subchild in html and web modes with the {C-c
      RETURN} thing selection key.

    - Can now select comments when at a comment start; try it with
      the Action Key.

    - Can now select Lisp symbols with colons in them within help
      buffers since they often appear there.

  VARIABLES

    - hyperb:init-hook renamed to hyperbole-init-hook, a more standard name.
      See the GNU Hyperbole Manual for its usage.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.09
===========================================================================

  FRAMES

    - The Window-Configuration menu (minibuffer Win/ menu) now stores and
      restores frame-specific window configurations, allowing each frame to be
      dedicated to different types of work or groups of buffers.

  INSTALLATION

    - Installation is greatly simplified.  A single emacs initialization line
      of the form:  

        (require 'hyperbole (expand-file-name "hyperbole" "<HYPERBOLE-DIR>/")

      loads and initializes Hyperbole.  Please change your site-wide or
      personal initialization to this.  (No more setting of hyperb:dir and
      load-path nor copying of hsite-ex.el to hsite.el is required; Hyperbole
      does this for you).

  KEYS

    - A new Customize Menu option, Toggle-Smart-Key-Debug (minibuffer menu
      Cust/Debug-Toggle, {C-h h c d}), displays a message in the minibuffer
      every time the Action Key or Assist Key is pressed, showing the context
      of the press and its associated action, allowing you to easily see
      what is happening whenever you use a Smart Key.

      These messages are all prefaced with "(HyDebug)" and are accumulated in
      the *Messages* buffer for later viewing.

    - Smart Keys work in any completion buffer now, e.g. the ido.el completion
      buffer.

    - Horizontal and vertical mouse drags within a single window, that do not
      begin on a thing delimiter, are now simpler and more consistent.  An
      Action Key drag splits the window either below (horizontal drag) or
      side-by-side (vertical drag).  An Assist Key drag deletes the window.

    - Hyperbole no longer uses the right mouse button, so it is free for popup menus.
      The Assist Mouse Key is always on the Shift-Right mouse button as well as
      on a C-u prefix to the Action Mouse Key.

    - A new setting, `hmouse-middle-flag', when set to t (true) before Hyperbole
      is loaded adds the middle mouse key as an Action Key.  InfoDock does this
      by default.

    - ibuffer-mode, the dired-like menu listing for buffers, is now supported
      by the Smart Keys; it behaves similarly to that of Buffer-menu-mode.

    - Xref item listing mode is now supported by the Smart Keys; The Action
      Key displays an xref file line or just a file containing an xref.
      The Assist Key displays the same but leaves point in the listing buffer.
      Xref is a built-in Emacs package that displays definitions and
      cross-references of identifier strings.  It is similar to etags, but
      more general. 

  KOUTLINER

    - Now compatible with the latest version of outline.el (using invisible overlays).

    - All menus for the Hyperbole auto-numbered outliner, called the Koutliner,
      now begin with 'K'.  Some used to start with 'O'.  To edit the example
      Koutline, use {C-h h k e}.

    - {C-c C-a}  - Show-all, expand all cells nihe current view.
      {C-c C-o}  - Overview, show only first line of outline cells.
      {C-c C-t}  - Top-level, hide all cells below level 1 and show
                   only the first line of each level 1 cell.

      By default, these commands no longer affect the display of blank lines
      between cells.  But if given a prefix argument, they toggle blank
      lines display for quick view changes.

    - Values of `user-mail-address' or `message-user-fqdn' are now
      used to set the creator and modifier names in Koutline cells.

  MAIL LISTS

    - The menu item that composes mail to the bug-hyperbole mail list now
      includes any (HyDebug) messages output when the Hyperbole configuration
      option, hkey-debug is enabled (via the Customize Menu or via
      {C-h h c d}).


===========================================================================
*				    V5.08
===========================================================================

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added web version of the Hyperbole Manual.

  HYPERLINKS

    - Action Key presses on Texinfo menu items and @node item references now
      display the associated Texinfo node.  @code and @var references to Emacs
      Lisp identifiers now show the documentation for the identifiers.  As
      before, cross-references and file includes show the referenced items;
      keyboard key sequences invoke their associated bindings.

    - Action Key press on an Emacs push button activates the button.  An Assist
      Key press shows help for the button.

  KEYS

    - Delimited things, including lists, comments, strings, arrays/vectors,
      sets, functions and markup pair tags (e.g. <div> </div>), may now be
      selected, copied or moved with the Action and Assist mouse and keyboard
      keys whenever point is on the first character of the starting or ending
      delimiter.  For strings and comments, point must be on the first line.

    - New {C-c .} binding that jumps between the start and end delimiters of
      delimited things.  Try it on matching markup tag pairs in HTML and SGML
      modes.  If point is not immediately before or after a delimiter, this
      generally does nothing.

    - New {C-c RET} binding selects bigger and bigger syntactical units within
      a buffer with each successive invocation.  Double clicks of the left
      mouse button do the same thing.  Try it, you'll like it.

===========================================================================
*			            V5.07
===========================================================================

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for the latest pre-releases of Emacs 25 and new versions of
      XEmacs.

  HYPERLINKS

    - URL handling updated along with customization menus to support most
      popular web browsers in use.

    - Action Key on a mailto: URI starts composing mail to that address.

    - When testing file formats/suffixes for an external viewer in
      which to display the file, as a fallback, a MIME system mailcap
      file is used to find additional possible viewers.  See
      "http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mailcap" for information on mailcap files.

    - Jump to JavaScript identifier definitions.

    - History, {C-h h h}, now restores full multi-window and multi-frame display
      configurations (within a single Emacs session), rather than just returning
      to a prior location in a buffer.

    - Type {q} in a Hyperbole Help buffer hide that buffer and return to your prior
      location.

  KEYS

    - By default, Hyperbole now removes any mode-specific, local key
      bindings that conflict with the global Smart Key bindings
      (typically {Meta-Return}). Use the Customize/Toggle-Override-Local-Keys
      to disable (or re-enable) this feature.

  KOUTLINER

    - When running under InfoDock, its Go and Options menus now appear within
      the Koutliner menu.

    - With a prefix argument, Koutlines are exported to HTML with soft newlines
      rather than hard newlines, so text will flow based on browser window size.
      This option will remove line-by-line formatting within a cell, however.

  MENUS

    - New Find menu which can reduce a buffer to just matching or non-matching
      lines, run the 'grep' or 'fgrep' utilities on a file directory tree, or
      list matching lines in the current buffer or across all buffers with
      attached files.

    - Renamed Customization menu to Customize.

    - New Customize/Change-Key-Bindings menu lets you rebind any Hyperbole
      keys for your current emacs session.


  	         ------- VERY OLD CHANGES BELOW HERE -------

===========================================================================
*				    V4.18
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Default Action Key action is to signal an error (rather than display
      the Hyperbole minibuffer menu) since it was too easy to confuse new
      users with this behavior.  More skilled users can set
      `action-key-default-function' to do what they would like.

    - Fixed bug that caused proportional scrolling to not be the default when 
      the Action Key is pressed at the end of a line.

  KOUTLINER

    - Fixed filling behavior when used with the `filladapt' package under
      InfoDock.

    - Improved text file importation process.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.17
===========================================================================

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - The Action Key now recognizes existing local files without any
      delimiters (aside from whitespace).  This allows you to display files
      from directory listings or virtually anywhere within documents.
      Relative pathnames are resolved relative to the directory associated
      with the current buffer.

    - Extended find-file commands to handle http (www) and ftp URLs
      if the efs package is available and the
      Hyperbole/Customization/Find-File-Accepts-URLs is enabled.
      See "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File" for details.

    - Improved display of special files via external viewers.

    - Added support for jumping to the source of errors from the Weblint Perl
      package.

    - The `make' error implicit button type now accounts for movement from
      one directory to another within make output so that the right source
      file is selected.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Default personal rolo file renamed to "~/.rolo.otl" ("C:_rolo.otl" on
      Windows).  When the contact manager is loaded, it will automatically
      prompt you to rename this file when necessary.  You should rename it
      but if you choose not to the old rolo file will be searched.

    - Added `rolo-display-format-function' which can be used to customize the
      display of rolo search matches.  See the Info manual section,
      "(hyperbole)HyRolo Settings" for details. 

  KOUTLINER

    - Fixed interaction problem with the standard editor autofilling
      functions.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.16
===========================================================================

  This release fixes a number of small issues with tags table handling under
  GNU Emacs and Koutline export to HTML.

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Added support for selection of function names from a buffer in
      fume-list-mode created by the func-menu.el package.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.15
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Added support for the pop-tag-mark command {M-*} available in some
      editors to move back to prior code locations displayed from clicking
      the Action Key on an identifier or other cross-reference.  {C-u M-*}
      moves forward (instead of back) through this location history list.

    - Added support for multiple TAGS file searches when looking for an
      identifier definition from an Action Key click.  Each TAG file found in 
      an ancestor directory of the current directory is searched until an
      exact match is found (otherwise, an error message is displayed).
      This works only under newer editors whose tag support includes multiple
      tag file searching.

    - Added support for Action Key clicks on identifiers displayed in
      `help-mode' by the emacs Lisp variable and function documentation
      command under newer editor versions.

    - On case-insensitive OSes, automatically load OO-Browser Environment
      files named `oobr' instead of `OOBR'.

===========================================================================
*				 V4.11-4.14
===========================================================================

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Support for editing entries found from logical expression queries.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for XEmacs version 20 and above.

    - Support for NT Emacs and XEmacs on NT.

  KOUTLINER

    - New Demote, Promote, Tab-Key-Inserts-Spaces and Tab-Key-Tabs-Over
      items added to the Edit menu.

    - Hyperbole/Koutliner menu items are now deactivated when the
      current buffer is not a Koutline.

    - Meta-Backspace under XEmacs now does the right thing (deletes a word
      backwards by default).

  HYPERLINKS

    - An entry in (hpath:get-external-display-alist) used to externally display
      special file types may now contain a list of executables, the first of 
      which is found on a system is used to do the display.  The executable
      to use is recomputed each time a file is displayed to account for any
      changes in executables found in the search path.

    - Abbreviated URLs of the form www.domain.com are now properly
      recognized (there was a bug in earlier versions).

    - Added support for CRLF line endings used under Microsoft OSes.

    - Improved button highlighting initialization.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - New type, gnus-push-button, for clicking on or pressing buttons
      embedded in GNUS articles, e.g. to collapse and expand signatures.

    - Improved debugger stack backtrace recognition and source line jumping.

    - MANIFEST.suffix files are now recognized and treated like files named
      MANIFEST (allowing you to browse the contents by pressing the Action
      on entries within the file).

    - URL browsing now uses the `browse-url-browser-function' variable to
      determine which web browser to invoke.  The menus have been converted
      to use this variable as well.  Hyperbole will automatically read
      old settings of `action-key-url-function' and convert to this new
      standard.

      Additionally the Grail (Python-based) and Lynx (text-based) browsers
      have been added to the Customization menu.

    - Added initial point-and-click Python support.

  MOUSE SUPPORT

    - Better support for 2-button mice.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.10
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - When a region is active within your editor, the Action Mouse Key pastes
      the region within the window where it is clicked.

    - Better handling of selection of C++ `operator' methods.

    - An Action Key press on an entry in an OO-Browser OOBR-FTR feature tag
      file jumps to the definition of the entry within the source code.

    - Greatly improved selection of minibuffer arguments from completion
      buffers with the Action Key.

    - An Action Key click on any filename with OOBR (case-sensitive) within
      its name will now load the file as an OO-Browser Environment and
      display its classes within the OO-Browser.  (This used to work only for
      Files whose exact name was OOBR or OOBR-FTR.)

    - An Action Key press on a file whose suffix is .rdb now loads the file
      as an InfoDock RDB in-memory relational database file.  The InfoDock
      RDB package is available separately as part of InfoDock.

    - Added support for sending a URL to another web browser with an Action
      Key click when in a W3 web browser buffer.  Eliminated support for the
      old Mosaic browser.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - New type, id-cflow, used to browse C code call trees produced by
      InfoDock's "id-cflow.el" module.  See that file for details if you have
      InfoDock.

    - grep-msg type that displays source lines associated with grep messages
      and compiler error messages now supports Microsoft JVC error messages.

    - Improved URL identification, including support for terse URLs that
      contain no protocol prefix, e.g. www.gnu.org.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - The Rolo/Search-for-String (rolo-fgrep) command can now do logical
      searches using prefix logical expressions surrounded by parentheses:
        (or string1 string2)
	(xor string1 (and string2 string3)) ;; xor is exclusive-or
	(not string1)

    - Accelerated location of the alphabetized insertion point for a new
      contact entry by 3-fold.

  KOUTLINER

    - Koutlines can now be converted to nice looking HTML documents with one
      command, `kexport:html', on the menus as Koutline/Export-to-HTML.
      Relative identifiers, hyperlinks and idstamps are all properly exported
      to the HTML document.  Other cell attributes are not yet exported.

    - Autonumber labels in new outlines are now terminated with a "."
      rather than a space by default to better delimit labels.

    - Added kotl-mode:tab-flag which can allow easy insertion of many tab
      characters and can make the TAB key demote cells only when point is at
      the beginning of the cell.

    - Added support for indenting regions within a cell via the
      kotl-mode:indent-region command.

    - New menu item, Import-to-Koutline, for importing star-delimited
      outlines, other koutlines and Augment-system post-numbered outlines
      (ignore this if you don't know what the Augment system is).

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for GNU Emacs version 20 and above.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - The Hyperbole online manual can now be browsed automatically from
      within the Hyperbole distribution without the need to install it
      separately within the editor.

===========================================================================
*				V4.024-V4.027
===========================================================================

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Rewrote the Hyperbole manual for clarity and ease of reading.  Addded
      a number of images.

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Improved recognition of local file URLs.

    - Disabled the {C-c t} key which usually switches between Hyperbole
      and personal mouse settings since this is too easy for novices to
      press and then not know why their mouse keys have changed.

    - Emacs Lisp filenames without any pathname information are
      now properly displayed when the Action Key is depressed over
      them and they are delimited by quotes.

    - Action Key press over .dvi file names now invoke the Xdvi previewer
      by default.

    - Action Key press on Fortran90 identifiers now jump to their
      definitions if a TAGS table has been built.

    - Action Key press in a Texinfo file on an @xref, @pxref or @ref
      keyword displays the associated node within the Texinfo file.  An
      Action Key press within the braces of the cross-reference displays the
      online Info node associated with the cross-reference, if the Info
      manual has already been installed.

    - Image files may be displayed within the editor if the editor supports
      this and image-mode is available.

    - The new variable, mail-address-mode-list, determines the major modes
      in which Action Key presses on <delimited> mail addresses start
      composing mail to that address.

    - Action Key presses on lines in ctags files (tags) or etags files (TAGS)
      jump to either the pathname on the line or the definition of the tag
      on the current line.

    - Eliminated trailing commas from inclusion in URLs sent to a browser.

  KOUTLINER

    - Improved paragraph filling even more under InfoDock.

    - Eliminated local {M-BS} binding if it is already bound
      when the Koutliner is invoked.

    - Added +V interactive reading extension for reading a Koutliner View
      Spec within a Lisp command.

    - Added Label-Type/Set-Label-Separator menu item for changing the
      separator between Koutline cell numbers and their body text.

    - Added an `Example' menu item to the Koutliner menu to simplify
      interactive editing of the EXAMPLE.kotl file.

  BUTTONS

    - Info-directory-list setting is now recognized during
      link-to-Info-node button creations.

  MENUS

    - Added an item to add and remove the Hyperbole Menu from the menubar.

  MAIL READERS

    - Updated VM interface for version 6.19.


===========================================================================
*				   V4.023
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Action Key clicks on HTTP URLs use the Emacs internal web browser
      if not running under a window system.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Date stamps are added to each rolo entry when created and updated
      when edited.  This feature can be toggled on and off with: M-x
      rolo-toggle-datestamps RET, or via the Toggle-Rolo-Dates menu
      item on the Customization menu.

    - wrolo-add-hook is called after a new entry is added.
      wrolo-edit-hook is called after an entry is displayed for editing.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.02
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Support for new ID-edit mode (a part of InfoDock) that allows rapid,
      cutting, copying and yanking of regions plus fast display management.
      In this mode, the Action and Assist keys yank the previously selected
      region at point.

    - An Action Key press on a Java identifier jumps to its definition
      (if an associated TAGS file or OO-Browser environment exists).  The
      same is true for an `@see' cross-reference within a Java comment.  The
      variable, `smart-java-package-path,' determines where Java
      package source can be found when the OO-Browser is not in use.

    - An Action Key press on a double or single quoted Emacs Lisp filename
      (without any path) displays the file by looking for it among the
      directories in the variable, `load-path'.

    - If the Action Key is pressed on a function identifier that is defined
      in the same buffer as the reference clicked upon, it will now be
      displayed faster, since the func-menu package will be used.  The
      reference identifier will also flash when pressed, if the display
      device supports this.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Further support for MS-DOS, Windows NT Emacs, and Win-Emacs.

    - Fixed configuration setup problem when running Emacs on a dumb
      terminal.

  KOUTLINER

    - XEmacs 19.14 and above: Fixed display of current viewspec in the
      modeline to accomodate modeline extents (specialized modeline regions).
      This eliminated an error that occurred when reading in an Koutline file.

    - Fixed bug that prevented installation of Koutliner mode-specific
      menubar when running InfoDock.

  MENUS

    - New Hyperbole/About menu item added.  In minibuffer menus, this item is
      found under the Doc/ menu.

    - New window system menu, Hyperbole/Customization (and minibuffer menu,
      Cust/) added to set Hyperbole options, including where Hyperbole link
      referents are displayed, where URLs are displayed and whether to use
      proportional or windowful scrolling when a Smart Key is pressed at the
      end of a line.

    - The default setting of where Hyperbole link references are displayed
      may be set in "hsite.el" via the variable, `hpath:display-where'
      (after Hyperbole has been installed using `make install').
      See its documentation for detail.

    - The Hyperbole/Global-Button menu now includes a menu item that will
      activate each existing global button.  The Hyperbole/Explicit-Button
      menu does the same thing for explicit buttons in the current buffer.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Rolo-edit, bound to {e} in the rolo match buffer, now works properly
      if the rolo is loaded before the rest of the Hyperbole system.


===========================================================================
*			      V4.00 and V4.01
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - New variable, action-key-url-function, sets the function used to
      display URLs which are activated as implicit buttons with the Action
      Key.

    - Action or Assist Key presses at the end of a line now scroll
      proportionally, by default.  See the documentation for the variable,
      smart-scroll-proportional, and the Smart Scrolling section of the
      Hyperbole DEMO file, for more information.

    - Fixed bug that prevented browsing Info files in dired with the Action
      Key.

  BUTTON TYPES

    - "hsys-w3.el" is now automatically loaded so that the Action Key can
      follow URLs by default.  It defines the implicit button type, www-url. 

    - New implicit button type, text-toc, makes table of contents entries in
      README files jump to the associated section of the file.  Try it with
      this file once you have loaded the current version of Hyperbole.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - A lot of work has gone into reorganizing and rewriting the Hyperbole
      manual to improve its readability and completeness.  A full chapter on
      the Koutliner has been added.  Please take some time to read the parts
      of interest to you and send your feedback on what is good and what is
      not to the mail list, <hyperbole@hub.ucsb.edu>.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - MS-DOS and Windows NT Emacs 19 or Win-Emacs: Made Hyperbole work under
      all of these PC Emacs versions.

    - Emacs 19: Fixed bug that prevented Action Key selection of minibuffer
      menu items.

    - Emacs 19: Hyperbole menubar menus are now properly displayed.

    - Emacs 19: Action Key press on a filename that has a .info suffix
      displays the Top node for that info file in the Info browser.

  KOUTLINER

    - You can now view and edit koutlines with blank lines between cells
      turned off.  {C-c b} now toggles between showing or hiding blank lines.

    - Minibuffer menu item Otl/Below renamed to Otl/Downto so could add
      Otl/Blanks which toggles blank lines on and off.

    - {C-c C-o} which displays one line per cell, for an overview, now also
      turns off blank lines.

    - {C-c C-i} adds an attribute to the current cell.  It changes the
      attribute's value if it already exists.  Completion on existing
      attribute names from the cell is provided.

    - {C-c h}, which displays cell attributes, when given "0" as the cell id
      now displays the zero cell's attributes in addition to any other
      attributes shown.

    - By default, the Koutliner separates labels from cell contents by
      two spaces.  If you want to change the separator for the current
      outline, use {C-c M-l}.  {C-u C-c M-l} will additionally change
      the default separator value used when new outlines are created.

    - If you invoke {M-x kotl-mode RET} on a non-read-only, non-koutline
      buffer, it converts each paragraph in the buffer into a level 1 cell,
      and thereby creates a koutline buffer.  The conversion uses the
      buffer-specific variable, `paragraph-start' to determine the paragraphs
      in the buffer.

    - If you save a koutline to a file whose name does not end in .kotl,
      e.g. with {C-x C-w} (kfile:write), it will still be treated as a valid
      koutline when you read it in again.  You can create a koutline file
      without the standard suffix via {M-x kfile:find RET} or by converting a
      buffer to a koutline via {M-x kotl-mode RET}.

    - Each koutline now maintains a current view setting that is saved with
      the outline and restored when it is first displayed.  View settings
      include:  show/hide blank lines, show a fixed number of lines per cell,
      show a fixed number of levels in the outline, show all lines and cells,
      show/hide ellipses after truncated outline entries, set cell numbering
      (label) types.

    - View settings are controlled by single character codes called view
      specs.  The current view spec setting for a koutline appears in the
      modeline following the name of the outline.  The current view spec
      setting may be changed interactively with {C-c C-v}.
      See <${hyperb:dir}/kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl, 2b16=048> for details on valid
      view specs.

    - Minibuffer menu item Otl/View changed to Otl/Vspec to set a view
      specification.  Use {C-x C-r} to view a Koutline in read-only mode.

    - Added View menu to Koutliner popup and pulldown menus.  Moved
      view-related tree operations from Tree menu to View menu.

    - Fixed importation of star outline and Augment-style files.
    
    - The elements of a another buffer or file may be inserted into a
      koutline as a set of cells by using the {C-x i} command. When prompted,
      you may use a buffer name or file name from which to insert.

      The cells will be inserted as the successors of the current cell unless
      {C-u C-x i} is used and then they are inserted as the initial children
      of the current cell.

      See the documentation for the variables, kimport:mode-alist and
      kimport:suffix-alist, for information on mode and suffix-specific
      conversions performed on files before they are inserted.

      Use {M-x kimport:insert-file-contents RET} to insert the entire
      contents of a file into the current cell at the location of point.

    - {M-x kimport:file RET} will prompt for a file and a new koutline file
      to create and will insert the elements of the file in the new outline.
      (You can also use buffer or buffer names as arguments instead of file
      names.)  See the documentation for the variables, kimport:mode-alist
      and kimport:suffix-alist, for information on how the importation type
      is determined.

    - {C-c +} appends the contents of one cell to the end of another.  Added
      this as Append-Cell to popup and pulldown menus.
    
    - {M-w}, copy-region, now works properly in read-only outlines.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - {e} within a rolo match buffer edits the associated entry within your
      rolo source file.  Fixed bug that caused {e} to fail when entries
      are collapsed within the match buffer.

    - {C-h h r e}, rolo-edit, just displays your personal rolo file if you
      hit {RET} without specifying an entry name to edit.

    - {m} within a rolo match buffer composes mail to the the e-mail
      address at point or the first address following point.  Also added as
      Rolo/Mail minibuffer menu item and Rolo/Mail-to-Address for window
      system menus.

    - New variable, wrolo-yank-reformat-function permits reformatting of an
      entry yanked into the current buffer with {C-h h r y}, rolo-yank.

  WINDOW CONFIGURATIONS 

    - The minibuffer menu items, Win/PopRing and Win/YankRing now redisplay
      the Win menu after performing their actions.  This allows you to yank
      or pop window configurations repeatedly until you get to the one you
      want.
