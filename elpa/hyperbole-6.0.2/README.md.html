<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p><code>GNU Hyperbole</code> (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just
<code>Hyperbole</code>, is an efficient and programmable hypertextual information
management system implemented as a GNU Emacs package.  It works well
on GNU Emacs 24.4 or above.  It is designed and written by Bob Weiner.
Its main distribution site is: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole/">https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole/</a>.</p>

<p>It includes easy-to-use, powerful hypertextual button types without
the need to learn a markup language; a hierarchical, record-based
contact manager; a rapid window and frame control system; and a
powerful multi-level auto-numbered outliner.  All features are aimed
at making textual information management and display fast and easy.</p>

<p>Hyperbole allows hypertext buttons to be embedded within unstructured
and structured files, mail messages and news articles.  It offers
intuitive keyboard and mouse-based control of information display
within multiple windows.  It also provides point-and-click access to
World-Wide Web URLs, Info manuals, ftp archives, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole">Hyperbole wiki page</a>
explains the many ways it differs from and is complementary to Org mode.</p>

<p><img src="man/im/hyperbole-cv.png" alt="Hyperbole screenshot of the Koutliner, DEMO file and HyRolo"></p>

<h2 id="browsing-the-source">Browsing the Source</h2>

<p>To explore the Hyperbole source code rather than installing it for use,
    download a tar.gz source archive from either:</p>

<ul><li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/</a></li></ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/">http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/</a></li></ul>

<p>which will find the closest mirror of the GNU ftp site and show it to you.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Once you have Emacs set up at your site, GNU Hyperbole may be
installed by using the Emacs Package Manager.  If you are not
familiar with it, see the Packages section of the GNU Emacs Manual,
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Packages.html">Emacs Packages</a>. </p>

<p>If you have Hyperbole 5.10 or higher already installed and simply want to
upgrade it, invoke the Emacs Package Manager with {M-x list-packages RET},
then use the {U} key followed by the {x} key to upgrade all out-of-date
packages, Hyperbole among them.  Then skip the text below and move on to
the next section, <a href="#invocation">Invocation</a>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, to download and install the Hyperbole package, you should
add several lines to your personal Emacs initialization file,
typically &quot;~/.emacs&quot;.  For further details, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html">Emacs Init
File</a>.</p>

<p>Below are the lines to add:</p>

<div><pre><code class="language-none">(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil) ;; Prevent double loading of libraries
(package-initialize)
(unless (package-installed-p 'hyperbole)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'hyperbole))
(require 'hyperbole)</code></pre></div>

<hr>

<p>Now save the file and then restart Emacs.  Hyperbole will then be
downloaded and compiled for use with your version of Emacs; give it a
minute or two.  You may see a bunch of compilation warnings but these
can be safely ignored.</p>

<h2 id="invocation">Invocation</h2>

<p>Once Hyperbole has been installed for use at your site and loaded into your
Emacs session, it is ready for use.  You will see a Hyperbole menu on your
menubar and {C-h h} will display a Hyperbole menu in the minibuffer for
quick keyboard-based selection.</p>

<p>You can invoke Hyperbole commands in one of three ways:</p>

<p>use the Hyperbole menu on your menubar;</p>

<p><img src="man/im/menu-hyperbole.png" alt="Hyperbole Menubar Menu"></p>

<p>type {C-h h} or {M-x hyperbole RET} to bring up the Hyperbole main menu
   in the minibuffer window, for fast keyboard or mouse-based selection;
   select an item from this menu by typing the item's first letter; use {q}
   to quit from the menu.</p>

<p>use a specific Hyperbole command such as an Action Key click {M-RET} on
   a pathname to display the associated file or directory.</p>

<p>Use {C-h h d d} for an interactive demonstration of standard Hyperbole
button capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="man/im/demo.png" alt="Hyperbole screenshot of the DEMO"></p>

<p>{C-h h k e} offers a interactive demonstration of the Koutliner,
Hyperbole's multi-level autonumbered hypertextual outliner.</p>

<p><img src="man/im/koutliner.png" alt="Hyperbole screenshot of the Koutliner"></p>

<p>To try out HyControl, Hyperbole's interactive frame and window control
system, use {C-h h s w} for window control or {C-h h s f} for frame
control.  {t} switches between window and frame control once in one of
them.  Hyperbole also binds {C-c } for quick access to HyControl's
window control menu if it was not already bound prior to Hyperbole's
initialization.  A long video demonstrating most of HyControl's
features is available at https://youtu.be/M3-aMh1ccJk.</p>

<p>The above are the best interactive ways to learn about Hyperbole.
Hyperbole also includes the Hyperbole Manual, a full reference manual,
not a simple introduction.  It is included in the &quot;man/&quot; subdirectory
of the Hyperbole package directory in four forms:</p>

<p><a href="man/hyperbole.info">hyperbole.info</a>   - online Info browser version<br>
<a href="man/hyperbole.html">hyperbole.html</a>   - web HTML version<br>
<a href="man/hyperbole.pdf">hyperbole.pdf</a>     - printable version<br>
<a href="man/hyperbole.texi">hyperbole.texi</a>   - source form  </p>

<p>The Hyperbole package installation places the Info version of this manual
where needed and adds an entry for Hyperbole into the Info directory under
the Emacs category.  {C-h h d i} will let you browse the manual.  For web
browsing, point your browser at &quot;${hyperb:dir}/man/hyperbole.html&quot;,
wherever the Hyperbole package directory is on your system; often this is:
&quot;~/.emacs.d/elpa/hyperbole-${hyperb:version}/&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<p>Hyperbole consists of five parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Buttons and Smart Keys</strong>: A set of hyperbutton types which supply
   core hypertext and other behaviors.  Buttons may be added to
   documents (explicit buttons) with a simple drag between windows,
   no markup language needed.  Implicit buttons are patterns
   automatically recognized within text that perform actions,
   e.g. bug#24568 displays the bug status information for that bug
   number.</p>

<p>Buttons are accessed by clicking on them or referenced by name
   (global buttons), so they can be activated regardless of what is
   on screen.  Users can make simple changes to button types and
   those familiar with Emacs Lisp can prototype and deliver new
   types quickly with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Hyperbole includes two special `Smart Keys', the Action Key
   and the Assist Key, that perform an extensive array of
   context-sensitive operations across emacs usage, including
   activating and showing help for Hyperbole buttons.  In many
   popular Emacs modes, they allow you to perform common, sometimes
   complex operations without having to a different key for each
   operation.  Just press a Smart Key and the right thing happens;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contact and Text Finder</strong>: an interactive textual information
   management interface, including fast, flexible file and text
   finding commands.  A powerful, hierarchical contact manager,
   HyRolo, which anyone can use is also included.  It is easy to
   learn to use since it introduces only a few new mechanisms and
   has a menu interface, which may be operated from the keyboard or
   the mouse.</p>

<p><img src="man/im/menu-rolo.png" alt="HyRolo Menubar Menu"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Screen Control</strong>: the fastest, easiest-to-use window and frame
   control available for GNU Emacs.  With just a few keystrokes,
   you can shift from increasing a window's height by 5 lines
   to moving a frame by 220 pixels or immediately moving it to a
   screen corner.  Text in each window or frame may be enlarged
   or shrunk (zoomed) for easy viewing, plus many other features;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Koutliner</strong>: an advanced outliner with multi-level
   autonumbering and permanent ids attached to each outline node for
   use as hypertext link anchors, per node properties and flexible
   view specifications that can be embedded within links or used
   interactively;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Programming Library</strong>: a set of programming library classes for
   system developers who want to integrate Hyperbole with another
   user interface or as a back-end to a distinct system.  (All of
   Hyperbole is written in Emacs Lisp for ease of modification.
   Hyperbole has been engineered for real-world usage and is well
   structured).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A Hyperbole hypertext user works with buttons; he may create, modify, move
or delete buttons.  Each button performs a specific action, such as linking
to a file or executing a shell command.</p>

<p>There are three categories of Hyperbole buttons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Explicit Buttons</em>
      created by Hyperbole, accessible from within a single document; </p></li>
<li><p><em>Global Buttons</em>
      created by Hyperbole, accessible anywhere within a user's
      network of documents;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Implicit Buttons</em>
      buttons created and managed by other programs or embedded
      within the structure of a document, accessible from within a
      single document.  Hyperbole recognizes implicit buttons by
      contextual patterns given in their type specifications.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hyperbole buttons may be clicked upon with a mouse to activate them or to
describe their actions.  Thus, a user can always check how a button will act
before activating it.  Buttons may also be activated from a keyboard.  (In
fact, virtually all Hyperbole operations, including menu usage, may be
performed from any standard terminal interface, so one can use it on distant
machines that provide limited display access).</p>

<p>Hyperbole does not enforce any particular hypertext or information
management model, but instead allows you to organize your information in
large or small chunks as you see fit, organizing each bit as time allows.
The Hyperbole Koutliner and HyRolo tools organize textual hierarchies and
may also contain links to external information sources.</p>

<p>Some of Hyperbole's most important features include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Buttons may link to information or may execute commands, such as
computing a complex value or communicating with external programs;</p></li>
<li><p>Buttons are quick and easy to create with no programming nor
markup needed.  One simply drags between a button source location
and a link destination to create or to modify a link button.  The
same result can be achieved from the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>Buttons may be embedded within email messages and activated from
Emacs mail readers; hyperlinks may include variables so that they
work at different locations where the variable settings differ;</p></li>
<li><p>Koutlines allow rapid browsing, editing and movement of chunks of
information organized into trees (hierarchies) and offer links
that include viewspecs which determine how documents are to be
displayed, e.g. show just the first two lines of all levels in a
Koutline;</p></li>
<li><p>Other hypertext and information retrieval systems may be
encapsulated under a Hyperbole user interface very easily.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Typical Hyperbole applications include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Personal Information Management</em><br>
Overlapping link paths provide a variety of views into an
information space.  A single key press activates buttons
regardless of their types, making navigation easy.</p>

<p>A search facility locates buttons in context and permits quick
selection.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Documentation Browsing</em><br>
Embedding cross-references in a favorite documentation format.</p>

<p>Addition of a point-and-click interface to existing documentation.</p>

<p>Linkage of code and design documents.  Jumping to the definition
of an identifier from its use within code or its reference within
documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Brainstorming</em><br>
Capture of ideas and then quick reorganization with the Hyperbole
Koutliner.  Link to related ideas, eliminating the need to copy
and paste information into a single place.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Help/Training Systems</em><br>
Creation of tutorials with embedded buttons that show students how
things work while explaining the concepts, e.g. an introduction
to UNIX commands.  This technique can be much more effective than
descriptions alone.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Archive Managers</em><br>
Supplementation of programs that manage archives from incoming
information stream, having them add topic-based buttons that
link to the archive holdings.  Users can then search and create
their own links to archive entries.</p></li>

<p>One of the nicest things about Hyperbole is that it's available
   everywhere. Org-mode is a mode and its features are only available in
   *.org files. For instance if you dropped into `eshell' or `ansi-term' and
   did `ls', you can move point to any of the directory's contents, do M-RET
   (or Shift-Button2) and jump to that file.  And that's just one example.
   Note that this means that all Hyperbole functionality is available in
   *.org files as well.  To me, except for the Hyperbole outliner, that means
   complementary not conflicting. It's Hyperbole *and* org-mode, not
   Hyperbole vs. org-mode.

<p>Additionally, off the bat, I found it very well documented and for me
   that's a proxy for the quality of a package.  The maintainers are quite
   responsive.  There's plenty more functionality that I haven't uncovered yet
   but due to the ease of installation and the quality of the documentation,
   digging into it is actually fun.</p>

<p>For me, Emacs isn't Emacs without Hyperbole.  I have depended on Hyperbole
  daily since 1992, when I first started using it to manage my development
  environment.  It didn't take long before I could summon almost any
  information I needed directly from within my editing environment with an
  implicit button. Since I almost never have to slow down to look for
  things--one context-dependent button usually produces exactly what I need
  --I am able to maintain focus on the task I am working on and complete it
  more quickly.  With its gestural interface, seamless integration with other
  Emacs packages and incredibly useful set of core features.  I think that
  Hyperbole is one of the best designed and most easily extensible software
  products I have ever come across.  It is certainly the one which has made
  the biggest improvement in my personal productivity.</p>

<p>I've found Hyperbole (in conjunction with XEmacs) to be very useful
  for signal processing algorithm development.</p>

<p>For me, it has almost completely obsoleted the engineering notebook:
  I keep a set of files with ideas, algorithms, and results, linked
  together and to the implementation in C++ files.  Using XEmacs'
  support for embedding graphics, I've written a mode that accepts
  image tags (formatted like HTML), and reads in GIF files to display
  plots.  I have another program that converts the file to HTML (not
  perfect, but adequate), so I can put any aspect of development on
  our internal web for others to see.</p>

<p>I am blind and have been using Hyperbole since 1992.  I used to use a PC as
  a talking terminal attached to a UNIX system, but then I developed
  Emacspeak which lets me use Emacs and Hyperbole from standard UNIX
  workstations with an attached voice synthesizer.</p>

<p>My main uses are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Global and implicit buttons for jumping to ftp sites.</p></li>
<li><p>The contact manager with Emacspeak support.</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit buttons as part of comments made about a structured document.
  Each button jumps to the document section referred to by the comment.
  This is very, very useful.</p></li>
<li><p>The Hyperbole Koutliner, which I find a very useful tool.  I've
  implemented Emacspeak extensions to support it.</p>

<p>I've been a grateful Hyperbole user for a few years now.  Hyperbole's
  flexibility and ease of use is a marvel.</p>

<p>Mainly, I write easy little implicit button types (and corresponding action
  types) to make my life easier.  For example, I have an implicit button type
  to bury certain buffers when I click at their bottoms, one that recognizes
  a bug report record in various contexts and edits it, one that links pieces
  of test output in a log file to the corresponding test case source code
  (EXTREMELY helpful in interpreting test output), others that support our
  homegrown test framework, one that handles tree dired mode the way I'd
  like, one that completely handles wico menus (I've also overloaded the
  wconfig actions triggered by diagonal mouse drags with wicos actions), and
  a couple that support interaction with BBDB.</p>

<p>Other than that, I keep a global button file with 30 or so explicit buttons
  that do various little things, and I index saved mail messages by putting
  explicit link-to-mail buttons in an outline file.</p>

<p>In general, Hyperbole is an embeddable, highly extensible hypertext
  tool.  As such, I find it very useful. As it stands now, Hyperbole is
  particularly helpful for organizing ill-structured or loosely coupled
  information, in part because there are few tools geared for this purpose.
  Hyperbole also possesses a lot of potential in supporting a wider
  spectrum of structuredness, ranging from unstructured to highly
  structured environments, as well as structural changes over time.</p>

<p>Major Uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Menu interface to our own collaborative support environment called
CoReView: This interface brings together all top-level user commands
into a single partitioned screen, and allows the end user to interact
with the system using simple mouse-clicking instead of the meta-x key.</p></li>
<li><p>Gateway to internet resources: this includes links to major Internet
archive sites of various types of information. Links are made at both
directory and file levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative directory organizer: The hierarchical nature of the Unix
file system sometimes makes it difficult to find things quickly and
easily using directory navigational tools such as dired. Hyperbole
enables me to create various &quot;profile&quot; views of my directory tree, with
entries in these views referring to files anywhere in the hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizing and viewing online documentation: using Hyperbole along with
Hyper-man and Info makes it truly easy to look up online documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Other desktop organization tasks: including links to various mail
folders, saved newsgroup conversation threads, online note-taker,
emacs-command invocations, etc.</p>

<p>Hyperbole is the first hyper-link system I've run across that is
  actually part of the environment I use regularly, namely Emacs. The
  complete flexibility of the links is both impressive and expected -- the
  idea of making the link itself programmable is clever, and given that one
  assumes the full power of Emacs.  Being able to send email with buttons
  in it is a very powerful capability.  Using ange-ftp mode, one can make
  file references &quot;across the world&quot; as easily as normal file references.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say how much I enjoy using the Hyperbole Koutliner.
   It is a great way to quickly construct very readable technical documents
   that I can pass around to others.   Thanks for the great work.  </p>

<h2 id="why-was-hyperbole-developed">Why was Hyperbole developed?</h2>

<p>Hyperbole was originally designed to aid in research aimed at Personalized
Information production/retrieval Environments (PIEs).  Hyperbole was a
PIE Manager that provided services to PIE Tools.  PIEmail, a mail reader was
the only PIE Tool developed as part of this research but Hyperbole has
greatly expanded since then and has long been a production quality toolset.</p>

<p>An examination of many hypertext environments as background research did
not turn up any that seemed suitable for the research envisioned, mainly
due to the lack of rich, portable programmer and user environments.  We also
tired of trying to manage our own distributed information pools with standard
UNIX tools.  And so Hyperbole was conceived and raved about until it
got its name.</p>

<p>Since then Hyperbole has proved indispensible at improving information
access and organization in daily use over many years.  Why not start
improving your information handling efficiency today?</p>
