;;; hui-mouse.el --- Use key or mouse key for many functions, e.g. GNU Hyperbole menus

;; This file is part of GNU Hyperbole.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This code is machine independent.  It works best with a pointing device but
;;  may also be used from a keyboard.  When used with a pointing device it
;;  requires an Emacs command that sets point to the location of the pointing
;;  device's cursor.
;;
;;  If you want to use your shift-middle mouse button to select Hyperbole menu
;;  items and Hyperbole buttons, follow these instructions.
;;
;;  If you plan to use a mouse only with X windows (XEmacs, GNU Emacs
;;  19, or InfoDock), Mac OS X, or NEXTSTEP, and you want to use the
;;  shift-middle and shift-right buttons, you need not do any mouse
;;  configuration.  Your Emacs executable must have been built so as to
;;  include the mouse support files for your window system, however.  These
;;  are in the Emacs "src" directory: for X "x*.c".
;;
;;  To use a different mouse key or a different window system, modify the
;;  mouse key bindings in "hmouse-sh.el".
;;
;; Using the Action Mouse Key to browse through and delete files from
;; Dired listings is exceptionally nice, just as it is when reading mail.
