Go to imenu tag defined in all reachable buffers.
Reachable buffers are determined by applying functions in
`imenu-anywhere-buffer-filter-functions' to all buffers returned
by `imenu-anywhere-buffer-list-function'.

Sorting is done within each buffer and takes into account items'
length. Thus more recent buffers in `buffer-list' and shorter
entries have higher priority.

(autoload 'ido-imenu-anywhere "imenu-anywhere" "\
IDO interface for `imenu-anywhere'.
This is a simple wrapper around `imenu-anywhere' which uses
`ido-completing-read' as `completing-read-function'. If you use
`ido-ubiquitous' you might be better off by using `ido-anywhere'
instead, but there should be little or no difference.

IVY interface for `imenu-anywhere'
This is a simple wrapper around `imenu-anywhere' which uses

`helm' interface for `imenu-anywhere'.
Sorting is in increasing length of imenu symbols within each
buffer.  The pyramidal view allows distinguishing different
buffers.
