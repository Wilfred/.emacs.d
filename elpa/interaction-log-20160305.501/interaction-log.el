;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides a buffer *Emacs Log* showing the last hit
;; keys and executed commands, messages and file loads in
;; chronological order.  This enables you to reconstruct the last
;; seconds of your work with Emacs.  It's also useful for
;; giving presentations or making screencasts with Emacs.
;;
;; Installation: Put this file in your load path and byte-compile it.
;; To start logging automatically at startup, add this to your init
;; file:
;;
;; (require 'interaction-log)
;; (interaction-log-mode +1)
;;
;; You probably will want to have a hotkey for showing the log
;; buffer, so also add something like
;;
;; (global-set-key
;;  (kbd "C-h C-l")
;;  (lambda () (interactive) (display-buffer ilog-buffer-name)))
;;
;; Alternatively, there is a command `ilog-show-in-new-frame' that
;; you can use to display the log buffer in a little new frame whose
;; parameters can be controlled by customizing
;; `ilog-new-frame-parameters'.
;;
;; Usage: Use `interaction-log-mode' to toggle logging.  Enabling the
;; mode will cause all messages and all pressed keys (along with the
;; actually executed command and the according buffer) to be logged
;; in the background.  Also loading of files will be logged.  If an
;; executed command causes any buffer to change, it will be
;; highlighted in orange so you can check if you made changes by
;; accident.  If a command caused any message to be displayed in the
;; echo area (e.g. if an error occurred), it is highlighted in red.
;;
;; If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please
;; tell me!
