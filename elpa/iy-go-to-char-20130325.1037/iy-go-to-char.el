;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines the function `iy-go-to-char' which behaves
;; like "f" in vim. It reads a char and go the next Nth occurence of
;; the char. User can continue such search using that char key.

;; To use, make sure this file is on your `load-path' and put the
;; following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'iy-go-to-char)
;;
;; Then you can bind functions like:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") 'iy-go-to-char)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c F") 'iy-go-to-char-backward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c ;") 'iy-go-to-char-continue)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c ,") 'iy-go-to-char-continue-backward)

;; Except repeating the char key, followings keys are defined before
;; quitting the search:
;;
;;    ;   -- search forward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-forward'
;;
;;    ,   -- search backward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-backward'
;;
;;    C-g -- quit
;;
;;    C-s -- start `isearch-forward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-r -- start `isearch-backward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-w -- quit and kill region between start and current point. If region is
;;           activated before search, then use the original mark instead of the
;;           start position.
;;
;;    M-w -- quit and save region between start and current point. If region is
;;           activated before search, use the mark instead of start position.
;;
;; All other keys will quit the search. Then the key event is
;; intepreted in the original environment before search.
;;
;; if the search quits because of error or using "C-g", point is set
;; back to the start position. Otherwise, point is not change and the
;; start position is set as marker. So you can use "C-x C-x" back to
;; that position.

;; `iy-go-to-char-backward' search backward by default. Not like in
;; "vim", ";" is always searching forward and "," is searching
;; backward, whether the search is started forward or backward. It
;; does be the same even when the search char is ";" or ",". Also the
;; search can cross lines. To continue search last char, use
;; `iy-go-to-char-continue' and `iy-go-to-char-continue-backward'.

;;; Change Log:
;; 2013-03-25 (2.1)
;;    - Fix a but that I forget to set `mc--this-command`
;; 2013-03-25 (2.0)
;;    - Use overriding-local-map to setup keymap
;;    - multiple-cursors compatible
;; 2012-04-16 (1.1)
;;    - fix C-s/C-r to enter isearch
