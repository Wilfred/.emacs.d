;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets users or programs set marks in a buffer prior to
;; changes so that we can track the original positions after the
;; change.

;; One common use is say when debugging a program.  The debugger has its static
;; notion of the file and positions inside that.  However it may be convenient
;; for a programmer to edit the program but not restart execution of the program.

;; Another use might be in a compilation buffer for errors and
;; warnings which refer to file and line positions.
