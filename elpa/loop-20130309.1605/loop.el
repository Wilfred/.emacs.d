;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs lisp is missing loop structures familiar to users of newer
;; languages. This library adds a selection of popular loop structures
;; as well as break and continue.

;;; Todo:

;; * Document
;; * Examples

;; Future ideas:

;; * loop-return
;; * Named loops so you can break/continue outer loops
