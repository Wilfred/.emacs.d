;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements links to Info nodes from within Org-mode.
;; Org-mode loads this module by default - if this is not what you want,
;; configure the variable `org-modules'.

;;; Code:

(require 'org)

;; Declare external functions and variables

(declare-function Info-find-node "info"
                  (filename nodename &optional no-going-back strict-case))
(defvar Info-current-file)
(defvar Info-current-node)

;; Install the link type
(org-add-link-type "info" 'org-info-open 'org-info-export)
(add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-info-store-link)

;; Implementation
(defun org-info-store-link ()
  "Store a link to an Info file and node."
  (when (eq major-mode 'Info-mode)
    (let (link desc)
      (setq link (concat "info:"
			 (file-name-nondirectory Info-current-file)
			 "#" Info-current-node))
      (setq desc (concat (file-name-nondirectory Info-current-file)
			 "#" Info-current-node))
      (org-store-link-props :type "info" :file Info-current-file
			    :node Info-current-node
			    :link link :desc desc)
      link)))

(defun org-info-open (path)
  "Follow an Info file and node link specified by PATH."
  (org-info-follow-link path))


(defun org-info-follow-link (name)
  "Follow an Info file and node link specified by NAME."
  (if (or (string-match "\\(.*\\)[#:]:?\\(.*\\)" name)
          (string-match "\\(.*\\)" name))
      (let ((filename (match-string 1 name))
	    (nodename-or-index (or (match-string 2 name) "Top")))
	(require 'info)
	;; If nodename-or-index is invalid node name, then look it up
	;; in the index.
	(condition-case nil
	    (Info-find-node filename nodename-or-index)
	  (user-error (Info-find-node filename "Top")
		      (condition-case nil
			  (Info-index nodename-or-index)
			(user-error "Could not find '%s' node or index entry"
				    nodename-or-index)))))
    (user-error "Could not open: %s" name)))

(defun org-info-export (path desc format)
  "Export an info link.
See `org-add-link-type' for details about PATH, DESC and FORMAT."
  (when (eq format 'html)
    (or (string-match "\\(.*\\)[#:]:?\\(.*\\)" path)
	(string-match "\\(.*\\)" path))
    (let ((filename (match-string 1 path))
	  (node (or (match-string 2 path) "Top")))
      (format "<a href=\"%s.html#%s\">%s</a>"
	      filename
	      (replace-regexp-in-string " " "-" node)
	      (or desc path)))))
