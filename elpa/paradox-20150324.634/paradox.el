;; Keywords: package packages mode-line
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (dash "2.6.0") (cl-lib "0.5") (json "1.3") (let-alist "1.0.3") (spinner "1.0"))
;; Prefix: paradox
;; Separator: -

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Paradox can be installed from Melpa with M-x `package-install' RET
;; paradox.
;; It can also be installed manually in the usual way, just be mindful of
;; the dependencies.
;;
;; To use it, simply call M-x `paradox-list-packages' (instead of the
;; regular `list-packages').
;; This will give you most features out of the box. If you want to be
;; able to star packages as well, just configure the
;; `paradox-github-token' variable then call `paradox-list-packages'
;; again.
;;
;; If you'd like to stop using Paradox, you may call `paradox-disable'
;; and go back to using the regular `list-packages'.
;;
;; ## Current Features ##
;;
;; ### Several Improvements ###
;;
;; Paradox implements many small improvements to the package menu
;; itself. They all work out of the box and are completely customizable!
;; *(Also, hit `h' to see all keys.)*
;;
;; * Visit the package's homepage with `v' (or just use the provided buttons).
;; * Shortcuts for package filtering:
;;     * <f r> filters by regexp (`occur');
;;     * <f u> display only packages with upgrades;
;;     * <f k> filters by keyword (Emacs 24.4 only).
;; * `hl-line-mode' enabled by default.
;; * Display useful information on the mode-line and cleanup a bunch of
;;   useless stuff.
;; * **Customization!** Just call M-x `paradox-customize' to see what you can
;;   do.
;;     * Customize column widths.
;;     * Customize faces (`paradox-star-face', `paradox-status-face-alist' and `paradox-archive-face').
;;     * Customize local variables.
;;
;; ### Package Ratings ###
;;
;; Paradox also integrates with
;; **GitHub Stars**, which works as **rough** package rating system.
;; That is, Paradox package menu will:
;;
;; 1. Display the number of GitHub Stars each package has (assuming it's
;;    in a github repo, of course);
;; 2. Possibly automatically star packages you install, and unstar
;;    packages you delete (you will be asked the first time whether you
;;    want this);
;; 3. Let you star and unstar packages by hitting the `s' key;
;; 4. Let you star all packages you have installed with M-x `paradox-star-all-installed-packages'.
;;
;; Item **1.** will work out of the box, the other items obviously
;; require a github account (Paradox will help you generate a token the
;; first time you call `paradox-list-packages').
;;
;; ## How Star Displaying Works ##
;;
;; We generate a map of Package Name -> Repository from
;; [Melpa](https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa.git)'s `recipe'
;; directory, some repos may correspond to more than one package.
;; This map is used count the stars a given package has.
;; _This doesn't mean you need Melpa to see the star counts, the numbers
;; will be displayed regardless of what archives you use._
;;
;; Currently, packages that are not hosted on GitHub are listed with a
;; blank star count, which is clearly different from 0-star packages
;; (which are displayed with a 0, obviously).
;; If you know of an alternative that could be used for these packages,
;; [open an issue](https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox/issues/new)
;; here, I'd love to hear.
