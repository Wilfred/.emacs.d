;;; python-info.el --- Python info manual for Emacs


;;; Commentary:
;; This file is deliberately empty, since this package just contains a
;; Python manual.  Emacs, however, requires us to have *something* that
;; describes the package.

;;; Code:

(provide 'python-info)

;;; python-info.el ends here
