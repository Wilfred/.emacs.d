1.1 What’s New in Python 2.7
============================

     Author: A.M. Kuchling (amk at amk.ca)

  This article explains the new features in Python 2.7.  Python 2.7 was
released on July 3, 2010.

  Numeric handling has been improved in many ways, for both
floating-point numbers and for the *note Decimal: 1b4. class.  There are
some useful additions to the standard library, such as a greatly
enhanced *note unittest: 187. module, the *note argparse: d. module for
parsing command-line options, convenient *note OrderedDict: 1b5. and
*note Counter: 1b6. classes in the *note collections: 65. module, and
many other improvements.

  Python 2.7 is planned to be the last of the 2.x releases, so we worked
on making it a good release for the long term.  To help with porting to
Python 3, several new features from the Python 3.x series have been
included in 2.7.

  This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For full
details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.7 at
‘http://docs.python.org’.  If you want to understand the rationale for
the design and implementation, refer to the PEP for a particular new
feature or the issue on ‘http://bugs.python.org’ in which a change was
discussed.  Whenever possible, "What’s New in Python" links to the
bug/patch item for each change.

1.1.1 The Future for Python 2.x
-------------------------------

Python 2.7 is the last major release in the 2.x series, as the Python
maintainers have shifted the focus of their new feature development
efforts to the Python 3.x series.  This means that while Python 2
continues to receive bug fixes, and to be updated to build correctly on
new hardware and versions of supported operated systems, there will be
no new full feature releases for the language or standard library.

  However, while there is a large common subset between Python 2.7 and
Python 3, and many of the changes involved in migrating to that common
subset, or directly to Python 3, can be safely automated, some other
changes (notably those associated with Unicode handling) may require
careful consideration, and preferably robust automated regression test
suites, to migrate effectively.

  This means that Python 2.7 will remain in place for a long time,
providing a stable and supported base platform for production systems
that have not yet been ported to Python 3.  The full expected lifecycle
of the Python 2.7 series is detailed in PEP 373(1).

  Some key consequences of the long-term significance of 2.7 are:

   * As noted above, the 2.7 release has a much longer period of
     maintenance when compared to earlier 2.x versions.  Python 2.7 is
     currently expected to remain supported by the core development team
     (receiving security updates and other bug fixes) until at least
     2020 (10 years after its initial release, compared to the more
     typical support period of 18-24 months).

   * As the Python 2.7 standard library ages, making effective use of
     the Python Package Index (either directly or via a redistributor)
     becomes more important for Python 2 users.  In addition to a wide
     variety of third party packages for various tasks, the available
     packages include backports of new modules and features from the
     Python 3 standard library that are compatible with Python 2, as
     well as various tools and libraries that can make it easier to
     migrate to Python 3.  The Python Packaging User Guide(2) provides
     guidance on downloading and installing software from the Python
     Package Index.

   * While the preferred approach to enhancing Python 2 is now the
     publication of new packages on the Python Package Index, this
     approach doesn’t necessarily work in all cases, especially those
     related to network security.  In exceptional cases that cannot be
     handled adequately by publishing new or updated packages on PyPI,
     the Python Enhancement Proposal process may be used to make the
     case for adding new features directly to the Python 2 standard
     library.  Any such additions, and the maintenance releases where
     they were added, will be noted in the *note New Features Added to
     Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases: 1b9. section below.

  For projects wishing to migrate from Python 2 to Python 3, or for
library and framework developers wishing to support users on both Python
2 and Python 3, there are a variety of tools and guides available to
help decide on a suitable approach and manage some of the technical
details involved.  The recommended starting point is the *note Porting
Python 2 Code to Python 3: 1ba. HOWTO guide.

1.1.2 Changes to the Handling of Deprecation Warnings
-----------------------------------------------------

For Python 2.7, a policy decision was made to silence warnings only of
interest to developers by default.  *note DeprecationWarning: 1bc. and
its descendants are now ignored unless otherwise requested, preventing
users from seeing warnings triggered by an application.  This change was
also made in the branch that became Python 3.2.  (Discussed on
stdlib-sig and carried out in issue 7319(1).)

  In previous releases, *note DeprecationWarning: 1bc. messages were
enabled by default, providing Python developers with a clear indication
of where their code may break in a future major version of Python.

  However, there are increasingly many users of Python-based
applications who are not directly involved in the development of those
applications.  *note DeprecationWarning: 1bc. messages are irrelevant to
such users, making them worry about an application that’s actually
working correctly and burdening application developers with responding
to these concerns.

  You can re-enable display of *note DeprecationWarning: 1bc. messages
by running Python with the *note -Wdefault: 1bd. (short form: *note -Wd:
1bd.) switch, or by setting the *note PYTHONWARNINGS: 1be. environment
variable to ‘"default"’ (or ‘"d"’) before running Python.  Python code
can also re-enable them by calling ‘warnings.simplefilter('default')’.

  The ‘unittest’ module also automatically reenables deprecation
warnings when running tests.

1.1.3 Python 3.1 Features
-------------------------

Much as Python 2.6 incorporated features from Python 3.0, version 2.7
incorporates some of the new features in Python 3.1.  The 2.x series
continues to provide tools for migrating to the 3.x series.

  A partial list of 3.1 features that were backported to 2.7:

   * The syntax for set literals (‘{1,2,3}’ is a mutable set).

   * Dictionary and set comprehensions (‘{i: i*2 for i in range(3)}’).

   * Multiple context managers in a single *note with: 1c0. statement.

   * A new version of the *note io: f9. library, rewritten in C for
     performance.

   * The ordered-dictionary type described in *note PEP 372; Adding an
     Ordered Dictionary to collections: 1c1.

   * The new ‘","’ format specifier described in *note PEP 378; Format
     Specifier for Thousands Separator: 1c2.

   * The *note memoryview: 1c3. object.

   * A small subset of the *note importlib: f6. module, *note described
     below: 1c4.

   * The *note repr(): 145. of a float ‘x’ is shorter in many cases:
     it’s now based on the shortest decimal string that’s guaranteed to
     round back to ‘x’.  As in previous versions of Python, it’s
     guaranteed that ‘float(repr(x))’ recovers ‘x’.

   * Float-to-string and string-to-float conversions are correctly
     rounded.  The *note round(): 1c5. function is also now correctly
     rounded.

   * The *note PyCapsule: 1c6. type, used to provide a C API for
     extension modules.

   * The *note PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow(): 1c7. C API function.

  Other new Python3-mode warnings include:

   * *note operator.isCallable(): 1c8. and *note
     operator.sequenceIncludes(): 1c9, which are not supported in 3.x,
     now trigger warnings.

   * The *note -3: 1ca. switch now automatically enables the *note
     -Qwarn: 1cb. switch that causes warnings about using classic
     division with integers and long integers.

1.1.4 PEP 372: Adding an Ordered Dictionary to collections
----------------------------------------------------------

Regular Python dictionaries iterate over key/value pairs in arbitrary
order.  Over the years, a number of authors have written alternative
implementations that remember the order that the keys were originally
inserted.  Based on the experiences from those implementations, 2.7
introduces a new *note OrderedDict: 1b5. class in the *note collections:
65. module.

  The *note OrderedDict: 1b5. API provides the same interface as regular
dictionaries but iterates over keys and values in a guaranteed order
depending on when a key was first inserted:

     >>> from collections import OrderedDict
     >>> d = OrderedDict([('first', 1),
     ...                  ('second', 2),
     ...                  ('third', 3)])
     >>> d.items()
     [('first', 1), ('second', 2), ('third', 3)]

  If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion
position is left unchanged:

     >>> d['second'] = 4
     >>> d.items()
     [('first', 1), ('second', 4), ('third', 3)]

  Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end:

     >>> del d['second']
     >>> d['second'] = 5
     >>> d.items()
     [('first', 1), ('third', 3), ('second', 5)]

  The *note popitem(): 1cd. method has an optional _last_ argument that
defaults to True.  If _last_ is True, the most recently added key is
returned and removed; if it’s False, the oldest key is selected:

     >>> od = OrderedDict([(x,0) for x in range(20)])
     >>> od.popitem()
     (19, 0)
     >>> od.popitem()
     (18, 0)
     >>> od.popitem(last=False)
     (0, 0)
     >>> od.popitem(last=False)
     (1, 0)

  Comparing two ordered dictionaries checks both the keys and values,
and requires that the insertion order was the same:

     >>> od1 = OrderedDict([('first', 1),
     ...                    ('second', 2),
     ...                    ('third', 3)])
     >>> od2 = OrderedDict([('third', 3),
     ...                    ('first', 1),
     ...                    ('second', 2)])
     >>> od1 == od2
     False
     >>> # Move 'third' key to the end
     >>> del od2['third']; od2['third'] = 3
     >>> od1 == od2
     True

  Comparing an *note OrderedDict: 1b5. with a regular dictionary ignores
the insertion order and just compares the keys and values.

  How does the *note OrderedDict: 1b5. work?  It maintains a
doubly-linked list of keys, appending new keys to the list as they’re
inserted.  A secondary dictionary maps keys to their corresponding list
node, so deletion doesn’t have to traverse the entire linked list and
therefore remains O(1).

  The standard library now supports use of ordered dictionaries in
several modules.

   * The *note ConfigParser: 6d. module uses them by default, meaning
     that configuration files can now be read, modified, and then
     written back in their original order.

   * The *note _asdict(): 1ce. method for *note
     collections.namedtuple(): 1cf. now returns an ordered dictionary
     with the values appearing in the same order as the underlying tuple
     indices.

   * The *note json: fc. module’s *note JSONDecoder: 1d0. class
     constructor was extended with an _object_pairs_hook_ parameter to
     allow ‘OrderedDict’ instances to be built by the decoder.  Support
     was also added for third-party tools like PyYAML(1).

1.1.5 PEP 378: Format Specifier for Thousands Separator
-------------------------------------------------------

To make program output more readable, it can be useful to add separators
to large numbers, rendering them as 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 instead
of 18446744073709551616.

  The fully general solution for doing this is the *note locale: 100.
module, which can use different separators ("," in North America, "."
in Europe) and different grouping sizes, but *note locale: 100. is
complicated to use and unsuitable for multi-threaded applications where
different threads are producing output for different locales.

  Therefore, a simple comma-grouping mechanism has been added to the
mini-language used by the *note str.format(): 1d2. method.  When
formatting a floating-point number, simply include a comma between the
width and the precision:

     >>> '{:20,.2f}'.format(18446744073709551616.0)
     '18,446,744,073,709,551,616.00'

  When formatting an integer, include the comma after the width:

     >>> '{:20,d}'.format(18446744073709551616)
     '18,446,744,073,709,551,616'

  This mechanism is not adaptable at all; commas are always used as the
separator and the grouping is always into three-digit groups.  The
comma-formatting mechanism isn’t as general as the *note locale: 100.
module, but it’s easier to use.

1.1.6 PEP 389: The argparse Module for Parsing Command Lines
------------------------------------------------------------

The *note argparse: d. module for parsing command-line arguments was
added as a more powerful replacement for the *note optparse: 127.
module.

  This means Python now supports three different modules for parsing
command-line arguments: *note getopt: de, *note optparse: 127, and *note
argparse: d.  The *note getopt: de. module closely resembles the C
library’s ‘getopt()’ function, so it remains useful if you’re writing a
Python prototype that will eventually be rewritten in C. *note optparse:
127. becomes redundant, but there are no plans to remove it because
there are many scripts still using it, and there’s no automated way to
update these scripts.  (Making the *note argparse: d. API consistent
with *note optparse: 127.’s interface was discussed but rejected as too
messy and difficult.)

  In short, if you’re writing a new script and don’t need to worry about
compatibility with earlier versions of Python, use *note argparse: d.
instead of *note optparse: 127.

  Here’s an example:

     import argparse

     parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Command-line example.')

     # Add optional switches
     parser.add_argument('-v', action='store_true', dest='is_verbose',
                         help='produce verbose output')
     parser.add_argument('-o', action='store', dest='output',
                         metavar='FILE',
                         help='direct output to FILE instead of stdout')
     parser.add_argument('-C', action='store', type=int, dest='context',
                         metavar='NUM', default=0,
                         help='display NUM lines of added context')

     # Allow any number of additional arguments.
     parser.add_argument(nargs='*', action='store', dest='inputs',
                         help='input filenames (default is stdin)')

     args = parser.parse_args()
     print args.__dict__

  Unless you override it, *note -h: 1d4. and *note –help: 1d5. switches
are automatically added, and produce neatly formatted output:

     -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py --help
     usage: argparse-example.py [-h] [-v] [-o FILE] [-C NUM] [inputs [inputs ...]]

     Command-line example.

     positional arguments:
       inputs      input filenames (default is stdin)

     optional arguments:
       -h, --help  show this help message and exit
       -v          produce verbose output
       -o FILE     direct output to FILE instead of stdout
       -C NUM      display NUM lines of added context

  As with *note optparse: 127, the command-line switches and arguments
are returned as an object with attributes named by the _dest_
parameters:

     -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py -v
     {'output': None,
      'is_verbose': True,
      'context': 0,
      'inputs': []}

     -> ./python.exe argparse-example.py -v -o /tmp/output -C 4 file1 file2
     {'output': '/tmp/output',
      'is_verbose': True,
      'context': 4,
      'inputs': ['file1', 'file2']}

  *note argparse: d. has much fancier validation than *note optparse:
127.; you can specify an exact number of arguments as an integer, 0 or
more arguments by passing ‘'*'’, 1 or more by passing ‘'+'’, or an
optional argument with ‘'?'’.  A top-level parser can contain
sub-parsers to define subcommands that have different sets of switches,
as in ‘svn commit’, ‘svn checkout’, etc.  You can specify an argument’s
type as *note FileType: 1d6, which will automatically open files for you
and understands that ‘'-'’ means standard input or output.

1.1.7 PEP 391: Dictionary-Based Configuration For Logging
---------------------------------------------------------

The *note logging: 101. module is very flexible; applications can define
a tree of logging subsystems, and each logger in this tree can filter
out certain messages, format them differently, and direct messages to a
varying number of handlers.

  All this flexibility can require a lot of configuration.  You can
write Python statements to create objects and set their properties, but
a complex set-up requires verbose but boring code.  *note logging: 101.
also supports a ‘fileConfig()’ function that parses a file, but the file
format doesn’t support configuring filters, and it’s messier to generate
programmatically.

  Python 2.7 adds a ‘dictConfig()’ function that uses a dictionary to
configure logging.  There are many ways to produce a dictionary from
different sources: construct one with code; parse a file containing
JSON; or use a YAML parsing library if one is installed.  For more
information see *note Configuration functions: 1d9.

  The following example configures two loggers, the root logger and a
logger named "network".  Messages sent to the root logger will be sent
to the system log using the syslog protocol, and messages to the
"network" logger will be written to a ‘network.log’ file that will be
rotated once the log reaches 1MB.

     import logging
     import logging.config

     configdict = {
      'version': 1,    # Configuration schema in use; must be 1 for now
      'formatters': {
          'standard': {
              'format': ('%(asctime)s %(name)-15s '
                         '%(levelname)-8s %(message)s')}},

      'handlers': {'netlog': {'backupCount': 10,
                          'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
                          'filename': '/logs/network.log',
                          'formatter': 'standard',
                          'level': 'INFO',
                          'maxBytes': 1000000},
                   'syslog': {'class': 'logging.handlers.SysLogHandler',
                              'formatter': 'standard',
                              'level': 'ERROR'}},

      # Specify all the subordinate loggers
      'loggers': {
                  'network': {
                              'handlers': ['netlog']
                  }
      },
      # Specify properties of the root logger
      'root': {
               'handlers': ['syslog']
      },
     }

     # Set up configuration
     logging.config.dictConfig(configdict)

     # As an example, log two error messages
     logger = logging.getLogger('/')
     logger.error('Database not found')

     netlogger = logging.getLogger('network')
     netlogger.error('Connection failed')

  Three smaller enhancements to the *note logging: 101. module, all
implemented by Vinay Sajip, are:

   * The *note SysLogHandler: 1da. class now supports syslogging over
     TCP. The constructor has a _socktype_ parameter giving the type of
     socket to use, either *note socket.SOCK_DGRAM: 1db. for UDP or
     *note socket.SOCK_STREAM: 1dc. for TCP. The default protocol
     remains UDP.

   * *note Logger: 1dd. instances gained a *note getChild(): 1de. method
     that retrieves a descendant logger using a relative path.  For
     example, once you retrieve a logger by doing ‘log =
     getLogger('app')’, calling ‘log.getChild('network.listen')’ is
     equivalent to ‘getLogger('app.network.listen')’.

   * The *note LoggerAdapter: 1df. class gained a ‘isEnabledFor()’
     method that takes a _level_ and returns whether the underlying
     logger would process a message of that level of importance.

1.1.8 PEP 3106: Dictionary Views
--------------------------------

The dictionary methods *note keys(): 1e1, *note values(): 1e2, and *note
items(): 1e3. are different in Python 3.x.  They return an object called
a _view_ instead of a fully materialized list.

  It’s not possible to change the return values of *note keys(): 1e1,
*note values(): 1e2, and *note items(): 1e3. in Python 2.7 because too
much code would break.  Instead the 3.x versions were added under the
new names *note viewkeys(): 1e4, *note viewvalues(): 1e5, and *note
viewitems(): 1e6.

     >>> d = dict((i*10, chr(65+i)) for i in range(26))
     >>> d
     {0: 'A', 130: 'N', 10: 'B', 140: 'O', 20: ..., 250: 'Z'}
     >>> d.viewkeys()
     dict_keys([0, 130, 10, 140, 20, 150, 30, ..., 250])

  Views can be iterated over, but the key and item views also behave
like sets.  The ‘&’ operator performs intersection, and ‘|’ performs a
union:

     >>> d1 = dict((i*10, chr(65+i)) for i in range(26))
     >>> d2 = dict((i**.5, i) for i in range(1000))
     >>> d1.viewkeys() & d2.viewkeys()
     set([0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0])
     >>> d1.viewkeys() | range(0, 30)
     set([0, 1, 130, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 120, 250])

  The view keeps track of the dictionary and its contents change as the
dictionary is modified:

     >>> vk = d.viewkeys()
     >>> vk
     dict_keys([0, 130, 10, ..., 250])
     >>> d[260] = '&'
     >>> vk
     dict_keys([0, 130, 260, 10, ..., 250])

  However, note that you can’t add or remove keys while you’re iterating
over the view:

     >>> for k in vk:
     ...     d[k*2] = k
     ...
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration

  You can use the view methods in Python 2.x code, and the 2to3
converter will change them to the standard *note keys(): 1e1, *note
values(): 1e2, and *note items(): 1e3. methods.

1.1.9 PEP 3137: The memoryview Object
-------------------------------------

The *note memoryview: 1c3. object provides a view of another object’s
memory content that matches the ‘bytes’ type’s interface.

     >>> import string
     >>> m = memoryview(string.letters)
     >>> m
     <memory at 0x37f850>
     >>> len(m)           # Returns length of underlying object
     52
     >>> m[0], m[25], m[26]   # Indexing returns one byte
     ('a', 'z', 'A')
     >>> m2 = m[0:26]         # Slicing returns another memoryview
     >>> m2
     <memory at 0x37f080>

  The content of the view can be converted to a string of bytes or a
list of integers:

     >>> m2.tobytes()
     'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
     >>> m2.tolist()
     [97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, ... 121, 122]
     >>>

  *note memoryview: 1c3. objects allow modifying the underlying object
if it’s a mutable object.

     >>> m2[0] = 75
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     TypeError: cannot modify read-only memory
     >>> b = bytearray(string.letters)  # Creating a mutable object
     >>> b
     bytearray(b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ')
     >>> mb = memoryview(b)
     >>> mb[0] = '*'         # Assign to view, changing the bytearray.
     >>> b[0:5]              # The bytearray has been changed.
     bytearray(b'*bcde')

PEP 3137(1) - Immutable Bytes and Mutable Buffer

     PEP written by Guido van Rossum.  Implemented by Travis Oliphant,
     Antoine Pitrou and others.  Backported to 2.7 by Antoine Pitrou;
     issue 2396(2).

1.1.10 Other Language Changes
-----------------------------

Some smaller changes made to the core Python language are:

   * The syntax for set literals has been backported from Python 3.x.
     Curly brackets are used to surround the contents of the resulting
     mutable set; set literals are distinguished from dictionaries by
     not containing colons and values.  ‘{}’ continues to represent an
     empty dictionary; use ‘set()’ for an empty set.

          >>> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
          set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
          >>> set() # empty set
          set([])
          >>> {}    # empty dict
          {}

     Backported by Alexandre Vassalotti; issue 2335(1).

   * Dictionary and set comprehensions are another feature backported
     from 3.x, generalizing list/generator comprehensions to use the
     literal syntax for sets and dictionaries.

          >>> {x: x*x for x in range(6)}
          {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
          >>> {('a'*x) for x in range(6)}
          set(['', 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'aaaa', 'aaaaa'])

     Backported by Alexandre Vassalotti; issue 2333(2).

   * The *note with: 1c0. statement can now use multiple context
     managers in one statement.  Context managers are processed from
     left to right and each one is treated as beginning a new *note
     with: 1c0. statement.  This means that:

          with A() as a, B() as b:
              ... suite of statements ...

     is equivalent to:

          with A() as a:
              with B() as b:
                  ... suite of statements ...

     The *note contextlib.nested(): 1e9. function provides a very
     similar function, so it’s no longer necessary and has been
     deprecated.

     (Proposed in ‘http://codereview.appspot.com/53094’; implemented by
     Georg Brandl.)

   * Conversions between floating-point numbers and strings are now
     correctly rounded on most platforms.  These conversions occur in
     many different places: *note str(): 1ea. on floats and complex
     numbers; the *note float: 1eb. and *note complex: 1ec.
     constructors; numeric formatting; serializing and deserializing
     floats and complex numbers using the *note marshal: 10b, *note
     pickle: 12d. and *note json: fc. modules; parsing of float and
     imaginary literals in Python code; and *note Decimal: 1b4.-to-float
     conversion.

     Related to this, the *note repr(): 145. of a floating-point number
     _x_ now returns a result based on the shortest decimal string
     that’s guaranteed to round back to _x_ under correct rounding (with
     round-half-to-even rounding mode).  Previously it gave a string
     based on rounding x to 17 decimal digits.

     The rounding library responsible for this improvement works on
     Windows and on Unix platforms using the gcc, icc, or suncc
     compilers.  There may be a small number of platforms where correct
     operation of this code cannot be guaranteed, so the code is not
     used on such systems.  You can find out which code is being used by
     checking *note sys.float_repr_style: 1ed, which will be ‘short’ if
     the new code is in use and ‘legacy’ if it isn’t.

     Implemented by Eric Smith and Mark Dickinson, using David Gay’s
     ‘dtoa.c’ library; issue 7117(3).

   * Conversions from long integers and regular integers to floating
     point now round differently, returning the floating-point number
     closest to the number.  This doesn’t matter for small integers that
     can be converted exactly, but for large numbers that will
     unavoidably lose precision, Python 2.7 now approximates more
     closely.  For example, Python 2.6 computed the following:

          >>> n = 295147905179352891391
          >>> float(n)
          2.9514790517935283e+20
          >>> n - long(float(n))
          65535L

     Python 2.7’s floating-point result is larger, but much closer to
     the true value:

          >>> n = 295147905179352891391
          >>> float(n)
          2.9514790517935289e+20
          >>> n - long(float(n))
          -1L

     (Implemented by Mark Dickinson; issue 3166(4).)

     Integer division is also more accurate in its rounding behaviours.
     (Also implemented by Mark Dickinson; issue 1811(5).)

   * Implicit coercion for complex numbers has been removed; the
     interpreter will no longer ever attempt to call a *note
     __coerce__(): 1ee. method on complex objects.  (Removed by Meador
     Inge and Mark Dickinson; issue 5211(6).)

   * The *note str.format(): 1d2. method now supports automatic
     numbering of the replacement fields.  This makes using *note
     str.format(): 1d2. more closely resemble using ‘%s’ formatting:

          >>> '{}:{}:{}'.format(2009, 04, 'Sunday')
          '2009:4:Sunday'
          >>> '{}:{}:{day}'.format(2009, 4, day='Sunday')
          '2009:4:Sunday'

     The auto-numbering takes the fields from left to right, so the
     first ‘{...}’ specifier will use the first argument to *note
     str.format(): 1d2, the next specifier will use the next argument,
     and so on.  You can’t mix auto-numbering and explicit numbering –
     either number all of your specifier fields or none of them – but
     you can mix auto-numbering and named fields, as in the second
     example above.  (Contributed by Eric Smith; issue 5237(7).)

     Complex numbers now correctly support usage with *note format():
     1ef, and default to being right-aligned.  Specifying a precision or
     comma-separation applies to both the real and imaginary parts of
     the number, but a specified field width and alignment is applied to
     the whole of the resulting ‘1.5+3j’ output.  (Contributed by Eric
     Smith; issue 1588(8) and issue 7988(9).)

     The ’F’ format code now always formats its output using uppercase
     characters, so it will now produce ’INF’ and ’NAN’.  (Contributed
     by Eric Smith; issue 3382(10).)

     A low-level change: the ‘object.__format__()’ method now triggers a
     *note PendingDeprecationWarning: 1f0. if it’s passed a format
     string, because the ‘__format__()’ method for *note object: 1f1.
     converts the object to a string representation and formats that.
     Previously the method silently applied the format string to the
     string representation, but that could hide mistakes in Python code.
     If you’re supplying formatting information such as an alignment or
     precision, presumably you’re expecting the formatting to be applied
     in some object-specific way.  (Fixed by Eric Smith; issue
     7994(11).)

   * The *note int(): 1f2. and *note long(): 1f3. types gained a
     ‘bit_length’ method that returns the number of bits necessary to
     represent its argument in binary:

          >>> n = 37
          >>> bin(n)
          '0b100101'
          >>> n.bit_length()
          6
          >>> n = 2**123-1
          >>> n.bit_length()
          123
          >>> (n+1).bit_length()
          124

     (Contributed by Fredrik Johansson and Victor Stinner; issue
     3439(12).)

   * The *note import: 1f4. statement will no longer try an absolute
     import if a relative import (e.g.  ‘from .os import sep’) fails.
     This fixes a bug, but could possibly break certain *note import:
     1f4. statements that were only working by accident.  (Fixed by
     Meador Inge; issue 7902(13).)

   * It’s now possible for a subclass of the built-in *note unicode:
     1f5. type to override the *note __unicode__(): 1f6. method.
     (Implemented by Victor Stinner; issue 1583863(14).)

   * The *note bytearray: 1f7. type’s ‘translate()’ method now accepts
     ‘None’ as its first argument.  (Fixed by Georg Brandl; issue
     4759(15).)

   * When using ‘@classmethod’ and ‘@staticmethod’ to wrap methods as
     class or static methods, the wrapper object now exposes the wrapped
     function as their ‘__func__’ attribute.  (Contributed by Amaury
     Forgeot d’Arc, after a suggestion by George Sakkis; issue
     5982(16).)

   * When a restricted set of attributes were set using ‘__slots__’,
     deleting an unset attribute would not raise *note AttributeError:
     1f8. as you would expect.  Fixed by Benjamin Peterson; issue
     7604(17).)

   * Two new encodings are now supported: "cp720", used primarily for
     Arabic text; and "cp858", a variant of CP 850 that adds the euro
     symbol.  (CP720 contributed by Alexander Belchenko and Amaury
     Forgeot d’Arc in issue 1616979(18); CP858 contributed by Tim Hatch
     in issue 8016(19).)

   * The *note file: 1f9. object will now set the ‘filename’ attribute
     on the *note IOError: 1fa. exception when trying to open a
     directory on POSIX platforms (noted by Jan Kaliszewski; issue
     4764(20)), and now explicitly checks for and forbids writing to
     read-only file objects instead of trusting the C library to catch
     and report the error (fixed by Stefan Krah; issue 5677(21)).

   * The Python tokenizer now translates line endings itself, so the
     *note compile(): 1fb. built-in function now accepts code using any
     line-ending convention.  Additionally, it no longer requires that
     the code end in a newline.

   * Extra parentheses in function definitions are illegal in Python
     3.x, meaning that you get a syntax error from ‘def f((x)): pass’.
     In Python3-warning mode, Python 2.7 will now warn about this odd
     usage.  (Noted by James Lingard; issue 7362(22).)

   * It’s now possible to create weak references to old-style class
     objects.  New-style classes were always weak-referenceable.  (Fixed
     by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8268(23).)

   * When a module object is garbage-collected, the module’s dictionary
     is now only cleared if no one else is holding a reference to the
     dictionary (issue 7140(24)).

1.1.10.1 Interpreter Changes
............................

A new environment variable, *note PYTHONWARNINGS: 1be, allows
controlling warnings.  It should be set to a string containing warning
settings, equivalent to those used with the *note -W: 1bd. switch,
separated by commas.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin; issue 7301(1).)

  For example, the following setting will print warnings every time they
occur, but turn warnings from the *note Cookie: 6f. module into an
error.  (The exact syntax for setting an environment variable varies
across operating systems and shells.)

     export PYTHONWARNINGS=all,error:::Cookie:0

File: python.info,  Node: Optimizations,  Prev: Interpreter Changes,  Up: Other Language Changes

1.1.10.2 Optimizations
......................

Several performance enhancements have been added:

   * A new opcode was added to perform the initial setup for *note with:
     1c0. statements, looking up the *note __enter__(): 1ff. and *note
     __exit__(): 200. methods.  (Contributed by Benjamin Peterson.)

   * The garbage collector now performs better for one common usage
     pattern: when many objects are being allocated without deallocating
     any of them.  This would previously take quadratic time for garbage
     collection, but now the number of full garbage collections is
     reduced as the number of objects on the heap grows.  The new logic
     only performs a full garbage collection pass when the middle
     generation has been collected 10 times and when the number of
     survivor objects from the middle generation exceeds 10% of the
     number of objects in the oldest generation.  (Suggested by Martin
     von Löwis and implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 4074(1).)

   * The garbage collector tries to avoid tracking simple containers
     which can’t be part of a cycle.  In Python 2.7, this is now true
     for tuples and dicts containing atomic types (such as ints,
     strings, etc.).  Transitively, a dict containing tuples of atomic
     types won’t be tracked either.  This helps reduce the cost of each
     garbage collection by decreasing the number of objects to be
     considered and traversed by the collector.  (Contributed by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 4688(2).)

   * Long integers are now stored internally either in base 2**15 or in
     base 2**30, the base being determined at build time.  Previously,
     they were always stored in base 2**15.  Using base 2**30 gives
     significant performance improvements on 64-bit machines, but
     benchmark results on 32-bit machines have been mixed.  Therefore,
     the default is to use base 2**30 on 64-bit machines and base 2**15
     on 32-bit machines; on Unix, there’s a new configure option
     ‘--enable-big-digits’ that can be used to override this default.

     Apart from the performance improvements this change should be
     invisible to end users, with one exception: for testing and
     debugging purposes there’s a new structseq *note sys.long_info:
     201. that provides information about the internal format, giving
     the number of bits per digit and the size in bytes of the C type
     used to store each digit:

          >>> import sys
          >>> sys.long_info
          sys.long_info(bits_per_digit=30, sizeof_digit=4)

     (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 4258(3).)

     Another set of changes made long objects a few bytes smaller: 2
     bytes smaller on 32-bit systems and 6 bytes on 64-bit.
     (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 5260(4).)

   * The division algorithm for long integers has been made faster by
     tightening the inner loop, doing shifts instead of multiplications,
     and fixing an unnecessary extra iteration.  Various benchmarks show
     speedups of between 50% and 150% for long integer divisions and
     modulo operations.  (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 5512(5).)
     Bitwise operations are also significantly faster (initial patch by
     Gregory Smith; issue 1087418(6)).

   * The implementation of ‘%’ checks for the left-side operand being a
     Python string and special-cases it; this results in a 1-3%
     performance increase for applications that frequently use ‘%’ with
     strings, such as templating libraries.  (Implemented by Collin
     Winter; issue 5176(7).)

   * List comprehensions with an ‘if’ condition are compiled into faster
     bytecode.  (Patch by Antoine Pitrou, back-ported to 2.7 by Jeffrey
     Yasskin; issue 4715(8).)

   * Converting an integer or long integer to a decimal string was made
     faster by special-casing base 10 instead of using a generalized
     conversion function that supports arbitrary bases.  (Patch by
     Gawain Bolton; issue 6713(9).)

   * The ‘split()’, ‘replace()’, ‘rindex()’, ‘rpartition()’, and
     ‘rsplit()’ methods of string-like types (strings, Unicode strings,
     and *note bytearray: 1f7. objects) now use a fast reverse-search
     algorithm instead of a character-by-character scan.  This is
     sometimes faster by a factor of 10.  (Added by Florent Xicluna;
     issue 7462(10) and issue 7622(11).)

   * The *note pickle: 12d. and *note cPickle: 73. modules now
     automatically intern the strings used for attribute names, reducing
     memory usage of the objects resulting from unpickling.
     (Contributed by Jake McGuire; issue 5084(12).)

   * The *note cPickle: 73. module now special-cases dictionaries,
     nearly halving the time required to pickle them.  (Contributed by
     Collin Winter; issue 5670(13).)

1.1.11 New and Improved Modules
-------------------------------

As in every release, Python’s standard library received a number of
enhancements and bug fixes.  Here’s a partial list of the most notable
changes, sorted alphabetically by module name.  Consult the ‘Misc/NEWS’
file in the source tree for a more complete list of changes, or look
through the Subversion logs for all the details.

   * The *note bdb: 18. module’s base debugging class *note Bdb: 203.
     gained a feature for skipping modules.  The constructor now takes
     an iterable containing glob-style patterns such as ‘django.*’; the
     debugger will not step into stack frames from a module that matches
     one of these patterns.  (Contributed by Maru Newby after a
     suggestion by Senthil Kumaran; issue 5142(1).)

   * The *note binascii: 19. module now supports the buffer API, so it
     can be used with *note memoryview: 1c3. instances and other similar
     buffer objects.  (Backported from 3.x by Florent Xicluna; issue
     7703(2).)

   * Updated module: the *note bsddb: 1c. module has been updated from
     4.7.2devel9 to version 4.8.4 of the pybsddb package(3).  The new
     version features better Python 3.x compatibility, various bug
     fixes, and adds several new BerkeleyDB flags and methods.  (Updated
     by Jesús Cea Avión; issue 8156(4).  The pybsddb changelog can be
     read at ‘http://hg.jcea.es/pybsddb/file/tip/ChangeLog’.)

   * The *note bz2: 1e. module’s *note BZ2File: 204. now supports the
     context management protocol, so you can write ‘with
     bz2.BZ2File(...) as f:’.  (Contributed by Hagen Fürstenau; issue
     3860(5).)

   * New class: the *note Counter: 1b6. class in the *note collections:
     65. module is useful for tallying data.  *note Counter: 1b6.
     instances behave mostly like dictionaries but return zero for
     missing keys instead of raising a *note KeyError: 205.:

          >>> from collections import Counter
          >>> c = Counter()
          >>> for letter in 'here is a sample of english text':
          ...   c[letter] += 1
          ...
          >>> c
          Counter({' ': 6, 'e': 5, 's': 3, 'a': 2, 'i': 2, 'h': 2,
          'l': 2, 't': 2, 'g': 1, 'f': 1, 'm': 1, 'o': 1, 'n': 1,
          'p': 1, 'r': 1, 'x': 1})
          >>> c['e']
          5
          >>> c['z']
          0

     There are three additional *note Counter: 1b6. methods.  *note
     most_common(): 206. returns the N most common elements and their
     counts.  *note elements(): 207. returns an iterator over the
     contained elements, repeating each element as many times as its
     count.  *note subtract(): 208. takes an iterable and subtracts one
     for each element instead of adding; if the argument is a dictionary
     or another ‘Counter’, the counts are subtracted.

          >>> c.most_common(5)
          [(' ', 6), ('e', 5), ('s', 3), ('a', 2), ('i', 2)]
          >>> c.elements() ->
             'a', 'a', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ',
             'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'g', 'f', 'i', 'i',
             'h', 'h', 'm', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'n', 'p', 's',
             's', 's', 'r', 't', 't', 'x'
          >>> c['e']
          5
          >>> c.subtract('very heavy on the letter e')
          >>> c['e']    # Count is now lower
          -1

     Contributed by Raymond Hettinger; issue 1696199(6).

     New class: *note OrderedDict: 1b5. is described in the earlier
     section *note PEP 372; Adding an Ordered Dictionary to collections:
     1c1.

     New method: The *note deque: 209. data type now has a *note
     count(): 20a. method that returns the number of contained elements
     equal to the supplied argument _x_, and a *note reverse(): 20b.
     method that reverses the elements of the deque in-place.  *note
     deque: 209. also exposes its maximum length as the read-only *note
     maxlen: 20c. attribute.  (Both features added by Raymond
     Hettinger.)

     The *note namedtuple: 1cf. class now has an optional _rename_
     parameter.  If _rename_ is true, field names that are invalid
     because they’ve been repeated or aren’t legal Python identifiers
     will be renamed to legal names that are derived from the field’s
     position within the list of fields:

          >>> from collections import namedtuple
          >>> T = namedtuple('T', ['field1', '$illegal', 'for', 'field2'], rename=True)
          >>> T._fields
          ('field1', '_1', '_2', 'field2')

     (Added by Raymond Hettinger; issue 1818(7).)

     Finally, the *note Mapping: 20d. abstract base class now returns
     *note NotImplemented: 20e. if a mapping is compared to another type
     that isn’t a ‘Mapping’.  (Fixed by Daniel Stutzbach; issue
     8729(8).)

   * Constructors for the parsing classes in the *note ConfigParser: 6d.
     module now take a _allow_no_value_ parameter, defaulting to false;
     if true, options without values will be allowed.  For example:

          >>> import ConfigParser, StringIO
          >>> sample_config = """
          ... [mysqld]
          ... user = mysql
          ... pid-file = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
          ... skip-bdb
          ... """
          >>> config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser(allow_no_value=True)
          >>> config.readfp(StringIO.StringIO(sample_config))
          >>> config.get('mysqld', 'user')
          'mysql'
          >>> print config.get('mysqld', 'skip-bdb')
          None
          >>> print config.get('mysqld', 'unknown')
          Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
          NoOptionError: No option 'unknown' in section: 'mysqld'

     (Contributed by Mats Kindahl; issue 7005(9).)

   * Deprecated function: *note contextlib.nested(): 1e9, which allows
     handling more than one context manager with a single *note with:
     1c0. statement, has been deprecated, because the *note with: 1c0.
     statement now supports multiple context managers.

   * The *note cookielib: 70. module now ignores cookies that have an
     invalid version field, one that doesn’t contain an integer value.
     (Fixed by John J. Lee; issue 3924(10).)

   * The *note copy: 71. module’s *note deepcopy(): 20f. function will
     now correctly copy bound instance methods.  (Implemented by Robert
     Collins; issue 1515(11).)

   * The *note ctypes: 78. module now always converts ‘None’ to a C NULL
     pointer for arguments declared as pointers.  (Changed by Thomas
     Heller; issue 4606(12).)  The underlying libffi library(13) has
     been updated to version 3.0.9, containing various fixes for
     different platforms.  (Updated by Matthias Klose; issue 8142(14).)

   * New method: the *note datetime: 7d. module’s *note timedelta: 210.
     class gained a *note total_seconds(): 211. method that returns the
     number of seconds in the duration.  (Contributed by Brian Quinlan;
     issue 5788(15).)

   * New method: the *note Decimal: 1b4. class gained a *note
     from_float(): 212. class method that performs an exact conversion
     of a floating-point number to a *note Decimal: 1b4.  This exact
     conversion strives for the closest decimal approximation to the
     floating-point representation’s value; the resulting decimal value
     will therefore still include the inaccuracy, if any.  For example,
     ‘Decimal.from_float(0.1)’ returns
     ‘Decimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')’.
     (Implemented by Raymond Hettinger; issue 4796(16).)

     Comparing instances of *note Decimal: 1b4. with floating-point
     numbers now produces sensible results based on the numeric values
     of the operands.  Previously such comparisons would fall back to
     Python’s default rules for comparing objects, which produced
     arbitrary results based on their type.  Note that you still cannot
     combine ‘Decimal’ and floating-point in other operations such as
     addition, since you should be explicitly choosing how to convert
     between float and *note Decimal: 1b4.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson;
     issue 2531(17).)

     The constructor for *note Decimal: 1b4. now accepts floating-point
     numbers (added by Raymond Hettinger; issue 8257(18)) and
     non-European Unicode characters such as Arabic-Indic digits
     (contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 6595(19)).

     Most of the methods of the *note Context: 213. class now accept
     integers as well as *note Decimal: 1b4. instances; the only
     exceptions are the *note canonical(): 214. and *note
     is_canonical(): 215. methods.  (Patch by Juan José Conti; issue
     7633(20).)

     When using *note Decimal: 1b4. instances with a string’s *note
     format(): 1d2. method, the default alignment was previously
     left-alignment.  This has been changed to right-alignment, which is
     more sensible for numeric types.  (Changed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     6857(21).)

     Comparisons involving a signaling NaN value (or ‘sNAN’) now signal
     ‘InvalidOperation’ instead of silently returning a true or false
     value depending on the comparison operator.  Quiet NaN values (or
     ‘NaN’) are now hashable.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     7279(22).)

   * The *note difflib: 82. module now produces output that is more
     compatible with modern *diff*/*patch* tools through one small
     change, using a tab character instead of spaces as a separator in
     the header giving the filename.  (Fixed by Anatoly Techtonik; issue
     7585(23).)

   * The Distutils ‘sdist’ command now always regenerates the ‘MANIFEST’
     file, since even if the ‘MANIFEST.in’ or ‘setup.py’ files haven’t
     been modified, the user might have created some new files that
     should be included.  (Fixed by Tarek Ziadé; issue 8688(24).)

   * The *note doctest: b5. module’s ‘IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL’ flag will
     now ignore the name of the module containing the exception being
     tested.  (Patch by Lennart Regebro; issue 7490(25).)

   * The *note email: bb. module’s *note Message: 216. class will now
     accept a Unicode-valued payload, automatically converting the
     payload to the encoding specified by ‘output_charset’.  (Added by
     R. David Murray; issue 1368247(26).)

   * The *note Fraction: 217. class now accepts a single float or *note
     Decimal: 1b4. instance, or two rational numbers, as arguments to
     its constructor.  (Implemented by Mark Dickinson; rationals added
     in issue 5812(27), and float/decimal in issue 8294(28).)

     Ordering comparisons (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>’, ‘>=’) between fractions and
     complex numbers now raise a *note TypeError: 218.  This fixes an
     oversight, making the *note Fraction: 217. match the other numeric
     types.

   * New class: *note FTP_TLS: 219. in the *note ftplib: d8. module
     provides secure FTP connections using TLS encapsulation of
     authentication as well as subsequent control and data transfers.
     (Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola; issue 2054(29).)

     The *note storbinary(): 21a. method for binary uploads can now
     restart uploads thanks to an added _rest_ parameter (patch by Pablo
     Mouzo; issue 6845(30).)

   * New class decorator: *note total_ordering(): 21b. in the *note
     functools: d9. module takes a class that defines an *note __eq__():
     21c. method and one of *note __lt__(): 21d, *note __le__(): 21e,
     *note __gt__(): 21f, or *note __ge__(): 220, and generates the
     missing comparison methods.  Since the *note __cmp__(): 221. method
     is being deprecated in Python 3.x, this decorator makes it easier
     to define ordered classes.  (Added by Raymond Hettinger; issue
     5479(31).)

     New function: *note cmp_to_key(): 222. will take an old-style
     comparison function that expects two arguments and return a new
     callable that can be used as the _key_ parameter to functions such
     as *note sorted(): 223, *note min(): 224. and *note max(): 225,
     etc.  The primary intended use is to help with making code
     compatible with Python 3.x.  (Added by Raymond Hettinger.)

   * New function: the *note gc: db. module’s *note is_tracked(): 226.
     returns true if a given instance is tracked by the garbage
     collector, false otherwise.  (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou; issue
     4688(32).)

   * The *note gzip: e5. module’s *note GzipFile: 227. now supports the
     context management protocol, so you can write ‘with
     gzip.GzipFile(...) as f:’ (contributed by Hagen Fürstenau; issue
     3860(33)), and it now implements the *note io.BufferedIOBase: 228.
     ABC, so you can wrap it with *note io.BufferedReader: 229. for
     faster processing (contributed by Nir Aides; issue 7471(34)).  It’s
     also now possible to override the modification time recorded in a
     gzipped file by providing an optional timestamp to the constructor.
     (Contributed by Jacques Frechet; issue 4272(35).)

     Files in gzip format can be padded with trailing zero bytes; the
     *note gzip: e5. module will now consume these trailing bytes.
     (Fixed by Tadek Pietraszek and Brian Curtin; issue 2846(36).)

   * New attribute: the *note hashlib: e6. module now has an *note
     algorithms: 22a. attribute containing a tuple naming the supported
     algorithms.  In Python 2.7, ‘hashlib.algorithms’ contains ‘('md5',
     'sha1', 'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha512')’.  (Contributed by
     Carl Chenet; issue 7418(37).)

   * The default *note HTTPResponse: 22b. class used by the *note
     httplib: ee. module now supports buffering, resulting in much
     faster reading of HTTP responses.  (Contributed by Kristján Valur
     Jónsson; issue 4879(38).)

     The *note HTTPConnection: 22c. and *note HTTPSConnection: 22d.
     classes now support a _source_address_ parameter, a ‘(host, port)’
     2-tuple giving the source address that will be used for the
     connection.  (Contributed by Eldon Ziegler; issue 3972(39).)

   * The ‘ihooks’ module now supports relative imports.  Note that
     ‘ihooks’ is an older module for customizing imports, superseded by
     the *note imputil: f7. module added in Python 2.0.  (Relative
     import support added by Neil Schemenauer.)

   * The *note imaplib: f2. module now supports IPv6 addresses.
     (Contributed by Derek Morr; issue 1655(40).)

   * New function: the *note inspect: f8. module’s *note getcallargs():
     22e. takes a callable and its positional and keyword arguments, and
     figures out which of the callable’s parameters will receive each
     argument, returning a dictionary mapping argument names to their
     values.  For example:

          >>> from inspect import getcallargs
          >>> def f(a, b=1, *pos, **named):
          ...     pass
          >>> getcallargs(f, 1, 2, 3)
          {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'pos': (3,), 'named': {}}
          >>> getcallargs(f, a=2, x=4)
          {'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'pos': (), 'named': {'x': 4}}
          >>> getcallargs(f)
          Traceback (most recent call last):
          ...
          TypeError: f() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)

     Contributed by George Sakkis; issue 3135(41).

   * Updated module: The *note io: f9. library has been upgraded to the
     version shipped with Python 3.1.  For 3.1, the I/O library was
     entirely rewritten in C and is 2 to 20 times faster depending on
     the task being performed.  The original Python version was renamed
     to the ‘_pyio’ module.

     One minor resulting change: the *note io.TextIOBase: 22f. class now
     has an ‘errors’ attribute giving the error setting used for
     encoding and decoding errors (one of ‘'strict'’, ‘'replace'’,
     ‘'ignore'’).

     The *note io.FileIO: 230. class now raises an *note OSError: 231.
     when passed an invalid file descriptor.  (Implemented by Benjamin
     Peterson; issue 4991(42).)  The *note truncate(): 232. method now
     preserves the file position; previously it would change the file
     position to the end of the new file.  (Fixed by Pascal Chambon;
     issue 6939(43).)

   * New function: ‘itertools.compress(data, selectors)’ takes two
     iterators.  Elements of _data_ are returned if the corresponding
     value in _selectors_ is true:

          itertools.compress('ABCDEF', [1,0,1,0,1,1]) =>
            A, C, E, F

     New function: ‘itertools.combinations_with_replacement(iter, r)’
     returns all the possible _r_-length combinations of elements from
     the iterable _iter_.  Unlike *note combinations(): 233, individual
     elements can be repeated in the generated combinations:

          itertools.combinations_with_replacement('abc', 2) =>
            ('a', 'a'), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'),
            ('b', 'b'), ('b', 'c'), ('c', 'c')

     Note that elements are treated as unique depending on their
     position in the input, not their actual values.

     The *note itertools.count(): 234. function now has a _step_
     argument that allows incrementing by values other than 1.  *note
     count(): 234. also now allows keyword arguments, and using
     non-integer values such as floats or *note Decimal: 1b4. instances.
     (Implemented by Raymond Hettinger; issue 5032(44).)

     *note itertools.combinations(): 233. and *note itertools.product():
     235. previously raised *note ValueError: 236. for values of _r_
     larger than the input iterable.  This was deemed a specification
     error, so they now return an empty iterator.  (Fixed by Raymond
     Hettinger; issue 4816(45).)

   * Updated module: The *note json: fc. module was upgraded to version
     2.0.9 of the simplejson package, which includes a C extension that
     makes encoding and decoding faster.  (Contributed by Bob Ippolito;
     issue 4136(46).)

     To support the new *note collections.OrderedDict: 1b5. type, *note
     json.load(): 237. now has an optional _object_pairs_hook_ parameter
     that will be called with any object literal that decodes to a list
     of pairs.  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger; issue 5381(47).)

   * The *note mailbox: 109. module’s *note Maildir: 238. class now
     records the timestamp on the directories it reads, and only
     re-reads them if the modification time has subsequently changed.
     This improves performance by avoiding unneeded directory scans.
     (Fixed by A.M. Kuchling and Antoine Pitrou; issue 1607951(48),
     issue 6896(49).)

   * New functions: the *note math: 10c. module gained *note erf(): 239.
     and *note erfc(): 23a. for the error function and the complementary
     error function, *note expm1(): 23b. which computes ‘e**x - 1’ with
     more precision than using *note exp(): 23c. and subtracting 1,
     *note gamma(): 23d. for the Gamma function, and *note lgamma():
     23e. for the natural log of the Gamma function.  (Contributed by
     Mark Dickinson and nirinA raseliarison; issue 3366(50).)

   * The *note multiprocessing: 119. module’s ‘Manager*’ classes can now
     be passed a callable that will be called whenever a subprocess is
     started, along with a set of arguments that will be passed to the
     callable.  (Contributed by lekma; issue 5585(51).)

     The ‘Pool’ class, which controls a pool of worker processes, now
     has an optional _maxtasksperchild_ parameter.  Worker processes
     will perform the specified number of tasks and then exit, causing
     the ‘Pool’ to start a new worker.  This is useful if tasks may leak
     memory or other resources, or if some tasks will cause the worker
     to become very large.  (Contributed by Charles Cazabon; issue
     6963(52).)

   * The *note nntplib: 124. module now supports IPv6 addresses.
     (Contributed by Derek Morr; issue 1664(53).)

   * New functions: the *note os: 128. module wraps the following POSIX
     system calls: *note getresgid(): 23f. and *note getresuid(): 240,
     which return the real, effective, and saved GIDs and UIDs; *note
     setresgid(): 241. and *note setresuid(): 242, which set real,
     effective, and saved GIDs and UIDs to new values; *note
     initgroups(): 243, which initialize the group access list for the
     current process.  (GID/UID functions contributed by Travis H.;
     issue 6508(54).  Support for initgroups added by Jean-Paul
     Calderone; issue 7333(55).)

     The *note os.fork(): 244. function now re-initializes the import
     lock in the child process; this fixes problems on Solaris when
     *note fork(): 244. is called from a thread.  (Fixed by Zsolt
     Cserna; issue 7242(56).)

   * In the *note os.path: 129. module, the *note normpath(): 245. and
     *note abspath(): 246. functions now preserve Unicode; if their
     input path is a Unicode string, the return value is also a Unicode
     string.  (*note normpath(): 245. fixed by Matt Giuca in issue
     5827(57); *note abspath(): 246. fixed by Ezio Melotti in issue
     3426(58).)

   * The *note pydoc: 13f. module now has help for the various symbols
     that Python uses.  You can now do ‘help('<<')’ or ‘help('@')’, for
     example.  (Contributed by David Laban; issue 4739(59).)

   * The *note re: 143. module’s *note split(): 247, *note sub(): 248,
     and *note subn(): 249. now accept an optional _flags_ argument, for
     consistency with the other functions in the module.  (Added by
     Gregory P. Smith.)

   * New function: *note run_path(): 24a. in the *note runpy: 14b.
     module will execute the code at a provided _path_ argument.  _path_
     can be the path of a Python source file (‘example.py’), a compiled
     bytecode file (‘example.pyc’), a directory (‘./package/’), or a zip
     archive (‘example.zip’).  If a directory or zip path is provided,
     it will be added to the front of ‘sys.path’ and the module *note
     __main__: 2. will be imported.  It’s expected that the directory or
     zip contains a ‘__main__.py’; if it doesn’t, some other
     ‘__main__.py’ might be imported from a location later in
     ‘sys.path’.  This makes more of the machinery of *note runpy: 14b.
     available to scripts that want to mimic the way Python’s command
     line processes an explicit path name.  (Added by Nick Coghlan;
     issue 6816(60).)

   * New function: in the *note shutil: 154. module, *note
     make_archive(): 24b. takes a filename, archive type (zip or
     tar-format), and a directory path, and creates an archive
     containing the directory’s contents.  (Added by Tarek Ziadé.)

     *note shutil: 154.’s *note copyfile(): 24c. and *note copytree():
     24d. functions now raise a ‘SpecialFileError’ exception when asked
     to copy a named pipe.  Previously the code would treat named pipes
     like a regular file by opening them for reading, and this would
     block indefinitely.  (Fixed by Antoine Pitrou; issue 3002(61).)

   * The *note signal: 155. module no longer re-installs the signal
     handler unless this is truly necessary, which fixes a bug that
     could make it impossible to catch the EINTR signal robustly.
     (Fixed by Charles-Francois Natali; issue 8354(62).)

   * New functions: in the *note site: 158. module, three new functions
     return various site- and user-specific paths.  *note
     getsitepackages(): 24e. returns a list containing all global
     site-packages directories, *note getusersitepackages(): 24f.
     returns the path of the user’s site-packages directory, and *note
     getuserbase(): 250. returns the value of the ‘USER_BASE’
     environment variable, giving the path to a directory that can be
     used to store data.  (Contributed by Tarek Ziadé; issue 6693(63).)

     The *note site: 158. module now reports exceptions occurring when
     the ‘sitecustomize’ module is imported, and will no longer catch
     and swallow the *note KeyboardInterrupt: 251. exception.  (Fixed by
     Victor Stinner; issue 3137(64).)

   * The *note create_connection(): 252. function gained a
     _source_address_ parameter, a ‘(host, port)’ 2-tuple giving the
     source address that will be used for the connection.  (Contributed
     by Eldon Ziegler; issue 3972(65).)

     The *note recv_into(): 253. and *note recvfrom_into(): 254. methods
     will now write into objects that support the buffer API, most
     usefully the *note bytearray: 1f7. and *note memoryview: 1c3.
     objects.  (Implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8104(66).)

   * The *note SocketServer: 15d. module’s ‘TCPServer’ class now
     supports socket timeouts and disabling the Nagle algorithm.  The
     ‘disable_nagle_algorithm’ class attribute defaults to False; if
     overridden to be True, new request connections will have the
     TCP_NODELAY option set to prevent buffering many small sends into a
     single TCP packet.  The *note timeout: 255. class attribute can
     hold a timeout in seconds that will be applied to the request
     socket; if no request is received within that time, *note
     handle_timeout(): 256. will be called and *note handle_request():
     257. will return.  (Contributed by Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue
     6192(67) and issue 6267(68).)

   * Updated module: the *note sqlite3: 15f. module has been updated to
     version 2.6.0 of the pysqlite package(69).  Version 2.6.0 includes
     a number of bugfixes, and adds the ability to load SQLite
     extensions from shared libraries.  Call the
     ‘enable_load_extension(True)’ method to enable extensions, and then
     call *note load_extension(): 258. to load a particular shared
     library.  (Updated by Gerhard Häring.)

   * The *note ssl: 160. module’s ‘SSLSocket’ objects now support the
     buffer API, which fixed a test suite failure (fix by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 7133(70)) and automatically set OpenSSL’s
     ‘SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY’, which will prevent an error code being
     returned from ‘recv()’ operations that trigger an SSL renegotiation
     (fix by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8222(71)).

     The *note ssl.wrap_socket(): 259. constructor function now takes a
     _ciphers_ argument that’s a string listing the encryption
     algorithms to be allowed; the format of the string is described in
     the OpenSSL documentation(72).  (Added by Antoine Pitrou; issue
     8322(73).)

     Another change makes the extension load all of OpenSSL’s ciphers
     and digest algorithms so that they’re all available.  Some SSL
     certificates couldn’t be verified, reporting an "unknown algorithm"
     error.  (Reported by Beda Kosata, and fixed by Antoine Pitrou;
     issue 8484(74).)

     The version of OpenSSL being used is now available as the module
     attributes *note ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION: 25a. (a string), *note
     ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO: 25b. (a 5-tuple), and *note
     ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER: 25c. (an integer).  (Added by Antoine
     Pitrou; issue 8321(75).)

   * The *note struct: 166. module will no longer silently ignore
     overflow errors when a value is too large for a particular integer
     format code (one of ‘bBhHiIlLqQ’); it now always raises a *note
     struct.error: 25d. exception.  (Changed by Mark Dickinson; issue
     1523(76).)  The *note pack(): 25e. function will also attempt to
     use *note __index__(): 25f. to convert and pack non-integers before
     trying the *note __int__(): 260. method or reporting an error.
     (Changed by Mark Dickinson; issue 8300(77).)

   * New function: the *note subprocess: 167. module’s *note
     check_output(): 261. runs a command with a specified set of
     arguments and returns the command’s output as a string when the
     command runs without error, or raises a *note CalledProcessError:
     262. exception otherwise.

          >>> subprocess.check_output(['df', '-h', '.'])
          'Filesystem     Size   Used  Avail Capacity  Mounted on\n
          /dev/disk0s2    52G    49G   3.0G    94%    /\n'

          >>> subprocess.check_output(['df', '-h', '/bogus'])
            ...
          subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['df', '-h', '/bogus']' returned non-zero exit status 1

     (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith.)

     The *note subprocess: 167. module will now retry its internal
     system calls on receiving an ‘EINTR’ signal.  (Reported by several
     people; final patch by Gregory P. Smith in issue 1068268(78).)

   * New function: *note is_declared_global(): 263. in the *note
     symtable: 16c. module returns true for variables that are
     explicitly declared to be global, false for ones that are
     implicitly global.  (Contributed by Jeremy Hylton.)

   * The *note syslog: 16f. module will now use the value of
     ‘sys.argv[0]’ as the identifier instead of the previous default
     value of ‘'python'’.  (Changed by Sean Reifschneider; issue
     8451(79).)

   * The ‘sys.version_info’ value is now a named tuple, with attributes
     named ‘major’, ‘minor’, ‘micro’, ‘releaselevel’, and ‘serial’.
     (Contributed by Ross Light; issue 4285(80).)

     *note sys.getwindowsversion(): 264. also returns a named tuple,
     with attributes named ‘major’, ‘minor’, ‘build’, *note platform:
     132, ‘service_pack’, ‘service_pack_major’, ‘service_pack_minor’,
     ‘suite_mask’, and ‘product_type’.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin;
     issue 7766(81).)

   * The *note tarfile: 171. module’s default error handling has
     changed, to no longer suppress fatal errors.  The default error
     level was previously 0, which meant that errors would only result
     in a message being written to the debug log, but because the debug
     log is not activated by default, these errors go unnoticed.  The
     default error level is now 1, which raises an exception if there’s
     an error.  (Changed by Lars Gustäbel; issue 7357(82).)

     *note tarfile: 171. now supports filtering the *note TarInfo: 265.
     objects being added to a tar file.  When you call *note add(): 266,
     you may supply an optional _filter_ argument that’s a callable.
     The _filter_ callable will be passed the *note TarInfo: 265. for
     every file being added, and can modify and return it.  If the
     callable returns ‘None’, the file will be excluded from the
     resulting archive.  This is more powerful than the existing
     _exclude_ argument, which has therefore been deprecated.  (Added by
     Lars Gustäbel; issue 6856(83).)  The *note TarFile: 267. class also
     now supports the context manager protocol.  (Added by Lars
     Gustäbel; issue 7232(84).)

   * The *note wait(): 268. method of the *note threading.Event: 269.
     class now returns the internal flag on exit.  This means the method
     will usually return true because *note wait(): 268. is supposed to
     block until the internal flag becomes true.  The return value will
     only be false if a timeout was provided and the operation timed
     out.  (Contributed by Tim Lesher; issue 1674032(85).)

   * The Unicode database provided by the *note unicodedata: 186. module
     is now used internally to determine which characters are numeric,
     whitespace, or represent line breaks.  The database also includes
     information from the ‘Unihan.txt’ data file (patch by Anders
     Chrigström and Amaury Forgeot d’Arc; issue 1571184(86)) and has
     been updated to version 5.2.0 (updated by Florent Xicluna; issue
     8024(87)).

   * The *note urlparse: 18a. module’s *note urlsplit(): 26a. now
     handles unknown URL schemes in a fashion compliant with RFC
     3986(88): if the URL is of the form ‘"<something>://..."’, the text
     before the ‘://’ is treated as the scheme, even if it’s a made-up
     scheme that the module doesn’t know about.  This change may break
     code that worked around the old behaviour.  For example, Python
     2.6.4 or 2.5 will return the following:

          >>> import urlparse
          >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
          ('invented', '', '//host/filename?query', '', '')

     Python 2.7 (and Python 2.6.5) will return:

          >>> import urlparse
          >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
          ('invented', 'host', '/filename?query', '', '')

     (Python 2.7 actually produces slightly different output, since it
     returns a named tuple instead of a standard tuple.)

     The *note urlparse: 18a. module also supports IPv6 literal
     addresses as defined by RFC 2732(89) (contributed by Senthil
     Kumaran; issue 2987(90)).

          >>> urlparse.urlparse('http://[1080::8:800:200C:417A]/foo')
          ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='[1080::8:800:200C:417A]',
                      path='/foo', params='', query='', fragment='')

   * New class: the *note WeakSet: 26b. class in the *note weakref: 195.
     module is a set that only holds weak references to its elements;
     elements will be removed once there are no references pointing to
     them.  (Originally implemented in Python 3.x by Raymond Hettinger,
     and backported to 2.7 by Michael Foord.)

   * The ElementTree library, ‘xml.etree’, no longer escapes ampersands
     and angle brackets when outputting an XML processing instruction
     (which looks like ‘<?xml-stylesheet href="#style1"?>’) or comment
     (which looks like ‘<!-- comment -->’).  (Patch by Neil Muller;
     issue 2746(91).)

   * The XML-RPC client and server, provided by the *note xmlrpclib:
     1aa. and *note SimpleXMLRPCServer: 157. modules, have improved
     performance by supporting HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and by optionally
     using gzip encoding to compress the XML being exchanged.  The gzip
     compression is controlled by the ‘encode_threshold’ attribute of
     ‘SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler’, which contains a size in bytes;
     responses larger than this will be compressed.  (Contributed by
     Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 6267(92).)

   * The *note zipfile: 1ab. module’s *note ZipFile: 26c. now supports
     the context management protocol, so you can write ‘with
     zipfile.ZipFile(...) as f:’.  (Contributed by Brian Curtin; issue
     5511(93).)

     *note zipfile: 1ab. now also supports archiving empty directories
     and extracts them correctly.  (Fixed by Kuba Wieczorek; issue
     4710(94).)  Reading files out of an archive is faster, and
     interleaving *note read(): 26d. and ‘readline()’ now works
     correctly.  (Contributed by Nir Aides; issue 7610(95).)

     The *note is_zipfile(): 26e. function now accepts a file object, in
     addition to the path names accepted in earlier versions.
     (Contributed by Gabriel Genellina; issue 4756(96).)

     The *note writestr(): 26f. method now has an optional
     _compress_type_ parameter that lets you override the default
     compression method specified in the *note ZipFile: 26c.
     constructor.  (Contributed by Ronald Oussoren; issue 6003(97).)

File: python.info,  Node: New module importlib,  Next: New module sysconfig,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.1 New module: importlib
..............................

Python 3.1 includes the *note importlib: f6. package, a
re-implementation of the logic underlying Python’s *note import: 1f4.
statement.  *note importlib: f6. is useful for implementors of Python
interpreters and to users who wish to write new importers that can
participate in the import process.  Python 2.7 doesn’t contain the
complete *note importlib: f6. package, but instead has a tiny subset
that contains a single function, *note import_module(): 271.

  ‘import_module(name, package=None)’ imports a module.  _name_ is a
string containing the module or package’s name.  It’s possible to do
relative imports by providing a string that begins with a ‘.’ character,
such as ‘..utils.errors’.  For relative imports, the _package_ argument
must be provided and is the name of the package that will be used as the
anchor for the relative import.  *note import_module(): 271. both
inserts the imported module into ‘sys.modules’ and returns the module
object.

  Here are some examples:

     >>> from importlib import import_module
     >>> anydbm = import_module('anydbm')  # Standard absolute import
     >>> anydbm
     <module 'anydbm' from '/p/python/Lib/anydbm.py'>
     >>> # Relative import
     >>> file_util = import_module('..file_util', 'distutils.command')
     >>> file_util
     <module 'distutils.file_util' from '/python/Lib/distutils/file_util.pyc'>

  *note importlib: f6. was implemented by Brett Cannon and introduced in
Python 3.1.


File: python.info,  Node: New module sysconfig,  Next: ttk Themed Widgets for Tk,  Prev: New module importlib,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.2 New module: sysconfig
..............................

The *note sysconfig: 16e. module has been pulled out of the Distutils
package, becoming a new top-level module in its own right.  *note
sysconfig: 16e. provides functions for getting information about
Python’s build process: compiler switches, installation paths, the
platform name, and whether Python is running from its source directory.

  Some of the functions in the module are:

   * *note get_config_var(): 273. returns variables from Python’s
     Makefile and the ‘pyconfig.h’ file.

   * *note get_config_vars(): 274. returns a dictionary containing all
     of the configuration variables.

   * *note get_path(): 275. returns the configured path for a particular
     type of module: the standard library, site-specific modules,
     platform-specific modules, etc.

   * *note is_python_build(): 276. returns true if you’re running a
     binary from a Python source tree, and false otherwise.

  Consult the *note sysconfig: 16e. documentation for more details and
for a complete list of functions.

  The Distutils package and *note sysconfig: 16e. are now maintained by
Tarek Ziadé, who has also started a Distutils2 package (source

1.1.11.3 ttk: Themed Widgets for Tk
...................................

Tcl/Tk 8.5 includes a set of themed widgets that re-implement basic Tk
widgets but have a more customizable appearance and can therefore more
closely resemble the native platform’s widgets.  This widget set was
originally called Tile, but was renamed to Ttk (for "themed Tk") on
being added to Tcl/Tck release 8.5.

  To learn more, read the *note ttk: 182. module documentation.  You may
also wish to read the Tcl/Tk manual page describing the Ttk theme
engine, available at ‘http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TkCmd/ttk_intro.htm’.
Some screenshots of the Python/Ttk code in use are at
‘http://code.google.com/p/python-ttk/wiki/Screenshots’.

  The *note ttk: 182. module was written by Guilherme Polo and added in
issue 2983(1).  An alternate version called ‘Tile.py’, written by Martin
Franklin and maintained by Kevin Walzer, was proposed for inclusion in
issue 2618(2), but the authors argued that Guilherme Polo’s work was
more comprehensive.

1.1.11.4 Updated module: unittest
.................................

The *note unittest: 187. module was greatly enhanced; many new features
were added.  Most of these features were implemented by Michael Foord,
unless otherwise noted.  The enhanced version of the module is
downloadable separately for use with Python versions 2.4 to 2.6,
packaged as the ‘unittest2’ package, from
‘http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2’.

  When used from the command line, the module can automatically discover
tests.  It’s not as fancy as py.test(1) or nose(2), but provides a
simple way to run tests kept within a set of package directories.  For
example, the following command will search the ‘test/’ subdirectory for
any importable test files named ‘test*.py’:

     python -m unittest discover -s test

  Consult the *note unittest: 187. module documentation for more
details.  (Developed in issue 6001(3).)

  The *note main(): 27a. function supports some other new options:

   * ‘-b’ or ‘--buffer’ will buffer the standard output and standard
     error streams during each test.  If the test passes, any resulting
     output will be discarded; on failure, the buffered output will be
     displayed.

   * *note -c: 27b. or ‘--catch’ will cause the control-C interrupt to
     be handled more gracefully.  Instead of interrupting the test
     process immediately, the currently running test will be completed
     and then the partial results up to the interruption will be
     reported.  If you’re impatient, a second press of control-C will
     cause an immediate interruption.

     This control-C handler tries to avoid causing problems when the
     code being tested or the tests being run have defined a signal
     handler of their own, by noticing that a signal handler was already
     set and calling it.  If this doesn’t work for you, there’s a *note
     removeHandler(): 27c. decorator that can be used to mark tests that
     should have the control-C handling disabled.

   * ‘-f’ or ‘--failfast’ makes test execution stop immediately when a
     test fails instead of continuing to execute further tests.
     (Suggested by Cliff Dyer and implemented by Michael Foord; issue
     8074(4).)

  The progress messages now show ’x’ for expected failures and ’u’ for
unexpected successes when run in verbose mode.  (Contributed by Benjamin
Peterson.)

  Test cases can raise the *note SkipTest: 27d. exception to skip a test
(issue 1034053(5)).

  The error messages for *note assertEqual(): 27e, *note assertTrue():
27f, and *note assertFalse(): 280. failures now provide more
information.  If you set the *note longMessage: 281. attribute of your
*note TestCase: 282. classes to True, both the standard error message
and any additional message you provide will be printed for failures.
(Added by Michael Foord; issue 5663(6).)

  The *note assertRaises(): 283. method now returns a context handler
when called without providing a callable object to run.  For example,
you can write this:

     with self.assertRaises(KeyError):
         {}['foo']

  (Implemented by Antoine Pitrou; issue 4444(7).)

  Module- and class-level setup and teardown fixtures are now supported.
Modules can contain ‘setUpModule()’ and ‘tearDownModule()’ functions.
Classes can have *note setUpClass(): 284. and *note tearDownClass():
285. methods that must be defined as class methods (using ‘@classmethod’
or equivalent).  These functions and methods are invoked when the test
runner switches to a test case in a different module or class.

  The methods *note addCleanup(): 286. and *note doCleanups(): 287. were
added.  *note addCleanup(): 286. lets you add cleanup functions that
will be called unconditionally (after *note setUp(): 288. if *note
setUp(): 288. fails, otherwise after *note tearDown(): 289.).  This
allows for much simpler resource allocation and deallocation during
tests (issue 5679(8)).

  A number of new methods were added that provide more specialized
tests.  Many of these methods were written by Google engineers for use
in their test suites; Gregory P. Smith, Michael Foord, and GvR worked on
merging them into Python’s version of *note unittest: 187.

   * *note assertIsNone(): 28a. and *note assertIsNotNone(): 28b. take
     one expression and verify that the result is or is not ‘None’.

   * *note assertIs(): 28c. and *note assertIsNot(): 28d. take two
     values and check whether the two values evaluate to the same object
     or not.  (Added by Michael Foord; issue 2578(9).)

   * *note assertIsInstance(): 28e. and *note assertNotIsInstance():
     28f. check whether the resulting object is an instance of a
     particular class, or of one of a tuple of classes.  (Added by Georg
     Brandl; issue 7031(10).)

   * *note assertGreater(): 290, *note assertGreaterEqual(): 291, *note
     assertLess(): 292, and *note assertLessEqual(): 293. compare two
     quantities.

   * *note assertMultiLineEqual(): 294. compares two strings, and if
     they’re not equal, displays a helpful comparison that highlights
     the differences in the two strings.  This comparison is now used by
     default when Unicode strings are compared with *note assertEqual():
     27e.

   * *note assertRegexpMatches(): 295. and *note
     assertNotRegexpMatches(): 296. checks whether the first argument is
     a string matching or not matching the regular expression provided
     as the second argument (issue 8038(11)).

   * *note assertRaisesRegexp(): 297. checks whether a particular
     exception is raised, and then also checks that the string
     representation of the exception matches the provided regular
     expression.

   * *note assertIn(): 298. and *note assertNotIn(): 299. tests whether
     _first_ is or is not in _second_.

   * *note assertItemsEqual(): 29a. tests whether two provided sequences
     contain the same elements.

   * *note assertSetEqual(): 29b. compares whether two sets are equal,
     and only reports the differences between the sets in case of error.

   * Similarly, *note assertListEqual(): 29c. and *note
     assertTupleEqual(): 29d. compare the specified types and explain
     any differences without necessarily printing their full values;
     these methods are now used by default when comparing lists and
     tuples using *note assertEqual(): 27e.  More generally, *note
     assertSequenceEqual(): 29e. compares two sequences and can
     optionally check whether both sequences are of a particular type.

   * *note assertDictEqual(): 29f. compares two dictionaries and reports
     the differences; it’s now used by default when you compare two
     dictionaries using *note assertEqual(): 27e.  *note
     assertDictContainsSubset(): 2a0. checks whether all of the
     key/value pairs in _first_ are found in _second_.

   * *note assertAlmostEqual(): 2a1. and *note assertNotAlmostEqual():
     2a2. test whether _first_ and _second_ are approximately equal.
     This method can either round their difference to an
     optionally-specified number of _places_ (the default is 7) and
     compare it to zero, or require the difference to be smaller than a
     supplied _delta_ value.

   * *note loadTestsFromName(): 2a3. properly honors the *note
     suiteClass: 2a4. attribute of the *note TestLoader: 2a5.  (Fixed by
     Mark Roddy; issue 6866(12).)

   * A new hook lets you extend the *note assertEqual(): 27e. method to
     handle new data types.  The *note addTypeEqualityFunc(): 2a6.
     method takes a type object and a function.  The function will be
     used when both of the objects being compared are of the specified
     type.  This function should compare the two objects and raise an
     exception if they don’t match; it’s a good idea for the function to
     provide additional information about why the two objects aren’t
     matching, much as the new sequence comparison methods do.

  *note unittest.main(): 27a. now takes an optional ‘exit’ argument.  If
False, *note main(): 27a. doesn’t call *note sys.exit(): 2a7, allowing
*note main(): 27a. to be used from the interactive interpreter.
(Contributed by J. Pablo Fernández; issue 3379(13).)

  *note TestResult: 2a8. has new *note startTestRun(): 2a9. and *note
stopTestRun(): 2aa. methods that are called immediately before and after
a test run.  (Contributed by Robert Collins; issue 5728(14).)

  With all these changes, the ‘unittest.py’ was becoming awkwardly
large, so the module was turned into a package and the code split into
several files (by Benjamin Peterson).  This doesn’t affect how the
module is imported or used.

File: python.info,  Node: Updated module ElementTree 1 3,  Prev: Updated module unittest,  Up: New and Improved Modules

1.1.11.5 Updated module: ElementTree 1.3
........................................

The version of the ElementTree library included with Python was updated
to version 1.3.  Some of the new features are:

   * The various parsing functions now take a _parser_ keyword argument
     giving an *note XMLParser: 2ad. instance that will be used.  This
     makes it possible to override the file’s internal encoding:

          p = ET.XMLParser(encoding='utf-8')
          t = ET.XML("""<root/>""", parser=p)

     Errors in parsing XML now raise a ‘ParseError’ exception, whose
     instances have a ‘position’ attribute containing a (_line_,
     _column_) tuple giving the location of the problem.

   * ElementTree’s code for converting trees to a string has been
     significantly reworked, making it roughly twice as fast in many
     cases.  The *note ElementTree.write(): 2ae. and ‘Element.write()’
     methods now have a _method_ parameter that can be "xml" (the
     default), "html", or "text".  HTML mode will output empty elements
     as ‘<empty></empty>’ instead of ‘<empty/>’, and text mode will skip
     over elements and only output the text chunks.  If you set the
     ‘tag’ attribute of an element to ‘None’ but leave its children in
     place, the element will be omitted when the tree is written out, so
     you don’t need to do more extensive rearrangement to remove a
     single element.

     Namespace handling has also been improved.  All ‘xmlns:<whatever>’
     declarations are now output on the root element, not scattered
     throughout the resulting XML. You can set the default namespace for
     a tree by setting the ‘default_namespace’ attribute and can
     register new prefixes with *note register_namespace(): 2af.  In XML
     mode, you can use the true/false _xml_declaration_ parameter to
     suppress the XML declaration.

   * New *note Element: 2b0. method: *note extend(): 2b1. appends the
     items from a sequence to the element’s children.  Elements
     themselves behave like sequences, so it’s easy to move children
     from one element to another:

          from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

          t = ET.XML("""<list>
            <item>1</item> <item>2</item>  <item>3</item>
          </list>""")
          new = ET.XML('<root/>')
          new.extend(t)

          # Outputs <root><item>1</item>...</root>
          print ET.tostring(new)

   * New ‘Element’ method: *note iter(): 2b2. yields the children of the
     element as a generator.  It’s also possible to write ‘for child in
     elem:’ to loop over an element’s children.  The existing method
     ‘getiterator()’ is now deprecated, as is ‘getchildren()’ which
     constructs and returns a list of children.

   * New ‘Element’ method: *note itertext(): 2b3. yields all chunks of
     text that are descendants of the element.  For example:

          t = ET.XML("""<list>
            <item>1</item> <item>2</item>  <item>3</item>
          </list>""")

          # Outputs ['\n  ', '1', ' ', '2', '  ', '3', '\n']
          print list(t.itertext())

   * Deprecated: using an element as a Boolean (i.e., ‘if elem:’) would
     return true if the element had any children, or false if there were
     no children.  This behaviour is confusing – ‘None’ is false, but so
     is a childless element?  – so it will now trigger a *note
     FutureWarning: 2b4.  In your code, you should be explicit: write
     ‘len(elem) != 0’ if you’re interested in the number of children, or
     ‘elem is not None’.

  Fredrik Lundh develops ElementTree and produced the 1.3 version; you
can read his article describing 1.3 at
‘http://effbot.org/zone/elementtree-13-intro.htm’.  Florent Xicluna
updated the version included with Python, after discussions on
python-dev and in issue 6472(1).)

File: python.info,  Node: Build and C API Changes,  Next: Other Changes and Fixes,  Prev: New and Improved Modules,  Up: What's New in Python 2 7

1.1.12 Build and C API Changes
------------------------------

Changes to Python’s build process and to the C API include:

   * The latest release of the GNU Debugger, GDB 7, can be scripted
     using Python(1).  When you begin debugging an executable program P,
     GDB will look for a file named ‘P-gdb.py’ and automatically read
     it.  Dave Malcolm contributed a ‘python-gdb.py’ that adds a number
     of commands useful when debugging Python itself.  For example,
     ‘py-up’ and ‘py-down’ go up or down one Python stack frame, which
     usually corresponds to several C stack frames.  ‘py-print’ prints
     the value of a Python variable, and ‘py-bt’ prints the Python stack
     trace.  (Added as a result of issue 8032(2).)

   * If you use the ‘.gdbinit’ file provided with Python, the "pyo"
     macro in the 2.7 version now works correctly when the thread being
     debugged doesn’t hold the GIL; the macro now acquires it before
     printing.  (Contributed by Victor Stinner; issue 3632(3).)

   * *note Py_AddPendingCall(): 2b6. is now thread-safe, letting any
     worker thread submit notifications to the main Python thread.  This
     is particularly useful for asynchronous IO operations.
     (Contributed by Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 4293(4).)

   * New function: *note PyCode_NewEmpty(): 2b7. creates an empty code
     object; only the filename, function name, and first line number are
     required.  This is useful for extension modules that are attempting
     to construct a more useful traceback stack.  Previously such
     extensions needed to call *note PyCode_New(): 2b8, which had many
     more arguments.  (Added by Jeffrey Yasskin.)

   * New function: *note PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc(): 2b9. creates a new
     exception class, just as the existing *note PyErr_NewException():
     2ba. does, but takes an extra ‘char *’ argument containing the
     docstring for the new exception class.  (Added by ’lekma’ on the
     Python bug tracker; issue 7033(5).)

   * New function: *note PyFrame_GetLineNumber(): 2bb. takes a frame
     object and returns the line number that the frame is currently
     executing.  Previously code would need to get the index of the
     bytecode instruction currently executing, and then look up the line
     number corresponding to that address.  (Added by Jeffrey Yasskin.)

   * New functions: *note PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow(): 1c7. and *note
     PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow(): 2bc. approximates a Python long
     integer as a C ‘long’ or ‘long long’.  If the number is too large
     to fit into the output type, an _overflow_ flag is set and returned
     to the caller.  (Contributed by Case Van Horsen; issue 7528(6) and
     issue 7767(7).)

   * New function: stemming from the rewrite of string-to-float
     conversion, a new *note PyOS_string_to_double(): 2bd. function was
     added.  The old *note PyOS_ascii_strtod(): 2be. and *note
     PyOS_ascii_atof(): 2bf. functions are now deprecated.

   * New function: *note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c0. sets the value of
     ‘sys.argv’ and can optionally update ‘sys.path’ to include the
     directory containing the script named by ‘sys.argv[0]’ depending on
     the value of an _updatepath_ parameter.

     This function was added to close a security hole for applications
     that embed Python.  The old function, *note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c1,
     would always update ‘sys.path’, and sometimes it would add the
     current directory.  This meant that, if you ran an application
     embedding Python in a directory controlled by someone else,
     attackers could put a Trojan-horse module in the directory (say, a
     file named ‘os.py’) that your application would then import and
     run.

     If you maintain a C/C++ application that embeds Python, check
     whether you’re calling *note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c1. and carefully
     consider whether the application should be using *note
     PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c0. with _updatepath_ set to false.

     Security issue reported as CVE-2008-5983(8); discussed in issue
     5753(9), and fixed by Antoine Pitrou.

   * New macros: the Python header files now define the following
     macros: ‘Py_ISALNUM’, ‘Py_ISALPHA’, ‘Py_ISDIGIT’, ‘Py_ISLOWER’,
     ‘Py_ISSPACE’, ‘Py_ISUPPER’, ‘Py_ISXDIGIT’, ‘Py_TOLOWER’, and
     ‘Py_TOUPPER’.  All of these functions are analogous to the C
     standard macros for classifying characters, but ignore the current
     locale setting, because in several places Python needs to analyze
     characters in a locale-independent way.  (Added by Eric Smith;
     issue 5793(10).)

   * Removed function: ‘PyEval_CallObject’ is now only available as a
     macro.  A function version was being kept around to preserve ABI
     linking compatibility, but that was in 1997; it can certainly be
     deleted by now.  (Removed by Antoine Pitrou; issue 8276(11).)

   * New format codes: the ‘PyFormat_FromString()’,
     ‘PyFormat_FromStringV()’, and *note PyErr_Format(): 2c2. functions
     now accept ‘%lld’ and ‘%llu’ format codes for displaying C’s ‘long
     long’ types.  (Contributed by Mark Dickinson; issue 7228(12).)

   * The complicated interaction between threads and process forking has
     been changed.  Previously, the child process created by *note
     os.fork(): 244. might fail because the child is created with only a
     single thread running, the thread performing the *note os.fork():
     244.  If other threads were holding a lock, such as Python’s import
     lock, when the fork was performed, the lock would still be marked
     as "held" in the new process.  But in the child process nothing
     would ever release the lock, since the other threads weren’t
     replicated, and the child process would no longer be able to
     perform imports.

     Python 2.7 acquires the import lock before performing an *note
     os.fork(): 244, and will also clean up any locks created using the
     *note threading: 179. module.  C extension modules that have
     internal locks, or that call ‘fork()’ themselves, will not benefit
     from this clean-up.

     (Fixed by Thomas Wouters; issue 1590864(13).)

   * The *note Py_Finalize(): 2c3. function now calls the internal
     ‘threading._shutdown()’ function; this prevents some exceptions
     from being raised when an interpreter shuts down.  (Patch by Adam
     Olsen; issue 1722344(14).)

   * When using the *note PyMemberDef: 2c4. structure to define
     attributes of a type, Python will no longer let you try to delete
     or set a ‘T_STRING_INPLACE’ attribute.

   * Global symbols defined by the *note ctypes: 78. module are now
     prefixed with ‘Py’, or with ‘_ctypes’.  (Implemented by Thomas
     Heller; issue 3102(15).)

   * New configure option: the ‘--with-system-expat’ switch allows
     building the ‘pyexpat’ module to use the system Expat library.
     (Contributed by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue
     7609(16).)

   * New configure option: the ‘--with-valgrind’ option will now disable
     the pymalloc allocator, which is difficult for the Valgrind
     memory-error detector to analyze correctly.  Valgrind will
     therefore be better at detecting memory leaks and overruns.
     (Contributed by James Henstridge; issue 2422(17).)

   * New configure option: you can now supply an empty string to
     ‘--with-dbmliborder=’ in order to disable all of the various DBM
     modules.  (Added by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue
     6491(18).)

   * The *configure* script now checks for floating-point rounding bugs
     on certain 32-bit Intel chips and defines a ‘X87_DOUBLE_ROUNDING’
     preprocessor definition.  No code currently uses this definition,
     but it’s available if anyone wishes to use it.  (Added by Mark
     Dickinson; issue 2937(19).)

     *configure* also now sets a ‘LDCXXSHARED’ Makefile variable for
     supporting C++ linking.  (Contributed by Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar
     Arahesis; issue 1222585(20).)

   * The build process now creates the necessary files for pkg-config
     support.  (Contributed by Clinton Roy; issue 3585(21).)

   * The build process now supports Subversion 1.7.  (Contributed by
     Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis; issue 6094(22).)

1.1.12.1 Capsules
.................

Python 3.1 adds a new C datatype, *note PyCapsule: 1c6, for providing a
C API to an extension module.  A capsule is essentially the holder of a
C ‘void *’ pointer, and is made available as a module attribute; for
example, the *note socket: 15c. module’s API is exposed as
‘socket.CAPI’, and *note unicodedata: 186. exposes ‘ucnhash_CAPI’.
Other extensions can import the module, access its dictionary to get the
capsule object, and then get the ‘void *’ pointer, which will usually
point to an array of pointers to the module’s various API functions.

  There is an existing data type already used for this, *note PyCObject:
2c7, but it doesn’t provide type safety.  Evil code written in pure
Python could cause a segmentation fault by taking a *note PyCObject:
2c7. from module A and somehow substituting it for the *note PyCObject:
2c7. in module B. Capsules know their own name, and getting the pointer
requires providing the name:

     void *vtable;

     if (!PyCapsule_IsValid(capsule, "mymodule.CAPI") {
             PyErr_SetString(PyExc_ValueError, "argument type invalid");
             return NULL;
     }

     vtable = PyCapsule_GetPointer(capsule, "mymodule.CAPI");

  You are assured that ‘vtable’ points to whatever you’re expecting.  If
a different capsule was passed in, *note PyCapsule_IsValid(): 2c8. would
detect the mismatched name and return false.  Refer to *note Providing a
C API for an Extension Module: 2c9. for more information on using these
objects.

  Python 2.7 now uses capsules internally to provide various
extension-module APIs, but the *note PyCObject_AsVoidPtr(): 2ca. was
modified to handle capsules, preserving compile-time compatibility with
the ‘CObject’ interface.  Use of *note PyCObject_AsVoidPtr(): 2ca. will
signal a *note PendingDeprecationWarning: 1f0, which is silent by
default.

  Implemented in Python 3.1 and backported to 2.7 by Larry Hastings;
discussed in issue 5630(1).

1.1.12.2 Port-Specific Changes: Windows
.......................................

   * The *note msvcrt: 117. module now contains some constants from the
     ‘crtassem.h’ header file: ‘CRT_ASSEMBLY_VERSION’,
     ‘VC_ASSEMBLY_PUBLICKEYTOKEN’, and ‘LIBRARIES_ASSEMBLY_NAME_PREFIX’.
     (Contributed by David Cournapeau; issue 4365(1).)

   * The *note _winreg: 3. module for accessing the registry now
     implements the *note CreateKeyEx(): 2cc. and *note DeleteKeyEx():
     2cd. functions, extended versions of previously-supported functions
     that take several extra arguments.  The *note
     DisableReflectionKey(): 2ce, *note EnableReflectionKey(): 2cf, and
     *note QueryReflectionKey(): 2d0. were also tested and documented.
     (Implemented by Brian Curtin: issue 7347(2).)

   * The new ‘_beginthreadex()’ API is used to start threads, and the
     native thread-local storage functions are now used.  (Contributed
     by Kristján Valur Jónsson; issue 3582(3).)

   * The *note os.kill(): 2d1. function now works on Windows.  The
     signal value can be the constants ‘CTRL_C_EVENT’,
     ‘CTRL_BREAK_EVENT’, or any integer.  The first two constants will
     send Control-C and Control-Break keystroke events to subprocesses;
     any other value will use the ‘TerminateProcess()’ API. (Contributed
     by Miki Tebeka; issue 1220212(4).)

   * The *note os.listdir(): 2d2. function now correctly fails for an
     empty path.  (Fixed by Hirokazu Yamamoto; issue 5913(5).)

   * The ‘mimelib’ module will now read the MIME database from the
     Windows registry when initializing.  (Patch by Gabriel Genellina;
     issue 4969(6).)

1.1.13 Other Changes and Fixes
------------------------------

   * Two benchmark scripts, ‘iobench’ and ‘ccbench’, were added to the
     ‘Tools’ directory.  ‘iobench’ measures the speed of the built-in
     file I/O objects returned by *note open(): 2d6. while performing
     various operations, and ‘ccbench’ is a concurrency benchmark that
     tries to measure computing throughput, thread switching latency,
     and IO processing bandwidth when performing several tasks using a
     varying number of threads.

   * The ‘Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py’ script now understands plural forms in
     ‘.po’ files.  (Fixed by Martin von Löwis; issue 5464(1).)

   * When importing a module from a ‘.pyc’ or ‘.pyo’ file with an
     existing ‘.py’ counterpart, the ‘co_filename’ attributes of the
     resulting code objects are overwritten when the original filename
     is obsolete.  This can happen if the file has been renamed, moved,
     or is accessed through different paths.  (Patch by Ziga Seilnacht
     and Jean-Paul Calderone; issue 1180193(2).)

   * The ‘regrtest.py’ script now takes a ‘--randseed=’ switch that
     takes an integer that will be used as the random seed for the ‘-r’
     option that executes tests in random order.  The ‘-r’ option also
     reports the seed that was used (Added by Collin Winter.)

   * Another ‘regrtest.py’ switch is ‘-j’, which takes an integer
     specifying how many tests run in parallel.  This allows reducing
     the total runtime on multi-core machines.  This option is
     compatible with several other options, including the *note -R: 2d7.
     switch which is known to produce long runtimes.  (Added by Antoine
     Pitrou, issue 6152(3).)  This can also be used with a new ‘-F’
     switch that runs selected tests in a loop until they fail.  (Added
     by Antoine Pitrou; issue 7312(4).)

   * When executed as a script, the ‘py_compile.py’ module now accepts
     ‘'-'’ as an argument, which will read standard input for the list
     of filenames to be compiled.  (Contributed by Piotr Ożarowski;
     issue 8233(5).)

1.1.14 Porting to Python 2.7
----------------------------

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that
may require changes to your code:

   * The *note range(): 2d9. function processes its arguments more
     consistently; it will now call *note __int__(): 260. on non-float,
     non-integer arguments that are supplied to it.  (Fixed by Alexander
     Belopolsky; issue 1533(1).)

   * The string *note format(): 1ef. method changed the default
     precision used for floating-point and complex numbers from 6
     decimal places to 12, which matches the precision used by *note
     str(): 1ea.  (Changed by Eric Smith; issue 5920(2).)

   * Because of an optimization for the *note with: 1c0. statement, the
     special methods *note __enter__(): 1ff. and *note __exit__(): 200.
     must belong to the object’s type, and cannot be directly attached
     to the object’s instance.  This affects new-style classes (derived
     from *note object: 1f1.) and C extension types.  (issue 6101(3).)

   * Due to a bug in Python 2.6, the _exc_value_ parameter to *note
     __exit__(): 200. methods was often the string representation of the
     exception, not an instance.  This was fixed in 2.7, so _exc_value_
     will be an instance as expected.  (Fixed by Florent Xicluna; issue
     7853(4).)

   * When a restricted set of attributes were set using ‘__slots__’,
     deleting an unset attribute would not raise *note AttributeError:
     1f8. as you would expect.  Fixed by Benjamin Peterson; issue
     7604(5).)

  In the standard library:

   * Operations with *note datetime: 2da. instances that resulted in a
     year falling outside the supported range didn’t always raise *note
     OverflowError: 2db.  Such errors are now checked more carefully and
     will now raise the exception.  (Reported by Mark Leander, patch by
     Anand B. Pillai and Alexander Belopolsky; issue 7150(6).)

   * When using *note Decimal: 1b4. instances with a string’s *note
     format(): 1ef. method, the default alignment was previously
     left-alignment.  This has been changed to right-alignment, which
     might change the output of your programs.  (Changed by Mark
     Dickinson; issue 6857(7).)

     Comparisons involving a signaling NaN value (or ‘sNAN’) now signal
     *note InvalidOperation: 2dc. instead of silently returning a true
     or false value depending on the comparison operator.  Quiet NaN
     values (or ‘NaN’) are now hashable.  (Fixed by Mark Dickinson;
     issue 7279(8).)

   * The ElementTree library, ‘xml.etree’, no longer escapes ampersands
     and angle brackets when outputting an XML processing instruction
     (which looks like ‘<?xml-stylesheet href="#style1"?>’) or comment
     (which looks like ‘<!– comment –>’).  (Patch by Neil Muller; issue
     2746(9).)

   * The ‘readline()’ method of *note StringIO: 2dd. objects now does
     nothing when a negative length is requested, as other file-like
     objects do.  (issue 7348(10)).

   * The *note syslog: 16f. module will now use the value of
     ‘sys.argv[0]’ as the identifier instead of the previous default
     value of ‘'python'’.  (Changed by Sean Reifschneider; issue
     8451(11).)

   * The *note tarfile: 171. module’s default error handling has
     changed, to no longer suppress fatal errors.  The default error
     level was previously 0, which meant that errors would only result
     in a message being written to the debug log, but because the debug
     log is not activated by default, these errors go unnoticed.  The
     default error level is now 1, which raises an exception if there’s
     an error.  (Changed by Lars Gustäbel; issue 7357(12).)

   * The *note urlparse: 18a. module’s *note urlsplit(): 26a. now
     handles unknown URL schemes in a fashion compliant with RFC
     3986(13): if the URL is of the form ‘"<something>://..."’, the text
     before the ‘://’ is treated as the scheme, even if it’s a made-up
     scheme that the module doesn’t know about.  This change may break
     code that worked around the old behaviour.  For example, Python
     2.6.4 or 2.5 will return the following:

          >>> import urlparse
          >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
          ('invented', '', '//host/filename?query', '', '')

     Python 2.7 (and Python 2.6.5) will return:

          >>> import urlparse
          >>> urlparse.urlsplit('invented://host/filename?query')
          ('invented', 'host', '/filename?query', '', '')

     (Python 2.7 actually produces slightly different output, since it
     returns a named tuple instead of a standard tuple.)

  For C extensions:

   * C extensions that use integer format codes with the ‘PyArg_Parse*’
     family of functions will now raise a *note TypeError: 218.
     exception instead of triggering a *note DeprecationWarning: 1bc.
     (issue 5080(14)).

   * Use the new *note PyOS_string_to_double(): 2bd. function instead of
     the old *note PyOS_ascii_strtod(): 2be. and *note
     PyOS_ascii_atof(): 2bf. functions, which are now deprecated.

  For applications that embed Python:

   * The *note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c0. function was added, letting
     applications close a security hole when the existing *note
     PySys_SetArgv(): 2c1. function was used.  Check whether you’re
     calling *note PySys_SetArgv(): 2c1. and carefully consider whether
     the application should be using *note PySys_SetArgvEx(): 2c0. with
     _updatepath_ set to false.

1.1.15 New Features Added to Python 2.7 Maintenance Releases
------------------------------------------------------------

New features may be added to Python 2.7 maintenance releases when the
situation genuinely calls for it.  Any such additions must go through
the Python Enhancement Proposal process, and make a compelling case for
why they can’t be adequately addressed by either adding the new feature
solely to Python 3, or else by publishing it on the Python Package
Index.

  In addition to the specific proposals listed below, there is a general
exemption allowing new ‘-3’ warnings to be added in any Python 2.7
maintenance release.

1.2 What’s New in Python 2.6
============================

     Author: A.M. Kuchling (amk at amk.ca)

  This article explains the new features in Python 2.6, released on
October 1 2008.  The release schedule is described in PEP 361(1).

  The major theme of Python 2.6 is preparing the migration path to
Python 3.0, a major redesign of the language.  Whenever possible, Python
2.6 incorporates new features and syntax from 3.0 while remaining
compatible with existing code by not removing older features or syntax.
When it’s not possible to do that, Python 2.6 tries to do what it can,
adding compatibility functions in a *note future_builtins: da. module
and a *note -3: 1ca. switch to warn about usages that will become
unsupported in 3.0.

  Some significant new packages have been added to the standard library,
such as the *note multiprocessing: 119. and *note json: fc. modules, but
there aren’t many new features that aren’t related to Python 3.0 in some
way.

  Python 2.6 also sees a number of improvements and bugfixes throughout
the source.  A search through the change logs finds there were 259
patches applied and 612 bugs fixed between Python 2.5 and 2.6.  Both
figures are likely to be underestimates.

  This article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For full
details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.6.  If you
want to understand the rationale for the design and implementation,
refer to the PEP for a particular new feature.  Whenever possible,
"What’s New in Python" links to the bug/patch item for each change.

1.2.1 Python 3.0
----------------

The development cycle for Python versions 2.6 and 3.0 was synchronized,
with the alpha and beta releases for both versions being made on the
same days.  The development of 3.0 has influenced many features in 2.6.

  Python 3.0 is a far-ranging redesign of Python that breaks
compatibility with the 2.x series.  This means that existing Python code
will need some conversion in order to run on Python 3.0.  However, not
all the changes in 3.0 necessarily break compatibility.  In cases where
new features won’t cause existing code to break, they’ve been backported
to 2.6 and are described in this document in the appropriate place.
Some of the 3.0-derived features are:

   * A *note __complex__(): 2e7. method for converting objects to a
     complex number.

   * Alternate syntax for catching exceptions: ‘except TypeError as
     exc’.

   * The addition of *note functools.reduce(): 2e8. as a synonym for the
     built-in *note reduce(): 2e9. function.

  Python 3.0 adds several new built-in functions and changes the
semantics of some existing builtins.  Functions that are new in 3.0 such
as *note bin(): 2ea. have simply been added to Python 2.6, but existing
builtins haven’t been changed; instead, the *note future_builtins: da.
module has versions with the new 3.0 semantics.  Code written to be
compatible with 3.0 can do ‘from future_builtins import hex, map’ as
necessary.

  A new command-line switch, *note -3: 1ca, enables warnings about
features that will be removed in Python 3.0.  You can run code with this
switch to see how much work will be necessary to port code to 3.0.  The
value of this switch is available to Python code as the boolean variable
*note sys.py3kwarning: 2eb, and to C extension code as
‘Py_Py3kWarningFlag’.

1.2.2 Changes to the Development Process
----------------------------------------

While 2.6 was being developed, the Python development process underwent
two significant changes: we switched from SourceForge’s issue tracker to
a customized Roundup installation, and the documentation was converted
from LaTeX to reStructuredText.

1.2.2.1 New Issue Tracker: Roundup
..................................

For a long time, the Python developers had been growing increasingly
annoyed by SourceForge’s bug tracker.  SourceForge’s hosted solution
doesn’t permit much customization; for example, it wasn’t possible to
customize the life cycle of issues.

  The infrastructure committee of the Python Software Foundation
therefore posted a call for issue trackers, asking volunteers to set up
different products and import some of the bugs and patches from
SourceForge.  Four different trackers were examined: Jira(1),
Launchpad(2), Roundup(3), and Trac(4).  The committee eventually settled
on Jira and Roundup as the two candidates.  Jira is a commercial product
that offers no-cost hosted instances to free-software projects; Roundup
is an open-source project that requires volunteers to administer it and
a server to host it.

  After posting a call for volunteers, a new Roundup installation was
set up at ‘http://bugs.python.org’.  One installation of Roundup can
host multiple trackers, and this server now also hosts issue trackers
for Jython and for the Python web site.  It will surely find other uses
in the future.  Where possible, this edition of "What’s New in Python"
links to the bug/patch item for each change.

  Hosting of the Python bug tracker is kindly provided by Upfront
Systems(5) of Stellenbosch, South Africa.  Martin von Loewis put a lot
of effort into importing existing bugs and patches from SourceForge; his
scripts for this import operation are at
‘http://svn.python.org/view/tracker/importer/’ and may be useful to
other projects wishing to move from SourceForge to Roundup.

1.2.2.2 New Documentation Format: reStructuredText Using Sphinx
...............................................................

The Python documentation was written using LaTeX since the project
started around 1989.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, most documentation
was printed out for later study, not viewed online.  LaTeX was widely
used because it provided attractive printed output while remaining
straightforward to write once the basic rules of the markup were
learned.

  Today LaTeX is still used for writing publications destined for
printing, but the landscape for programming tools has shifted.  We no
longer print out reams of documentation; instead, we browse through it
online and HTML has become the most important format to support.
Unfortunately, converting LaTeX to HTML is fairly complicated and Fred
L. Drake Jr., the long-time Python documentation editor, spent a lot of
time maintaining the conversion process.  Occasionally people would
suggest converting the documentation into SGML and later XML, but
performing a good conversion is a major task and no one ever committed
the time required to finish the job.

  During the 2.6 development cycle, Georg Brandl put a lot of effort
into building a new toolchain for processing the documentation.  The
resulting package is called Sphinx, and is available from
‘http://sphinx.pocoo.org/’.

  Sphinx concentrates on HTML output, producing attractively styled and
modern HTML; printed output is still supported through conversion to
LaTeX. The input format is reStructuredText, a markup syntax supporting
custom extensions and directives that is commonly used in the Python
community.

  Sphinx is a standalone package that can be used for writing, and
almost two dozen other projects (listed on the Sphinx web site(1)) have
adopted Sphinx as their documentation tool.

1.2.3 PEP 343: The ’with’ statement
-----------------------------------

The previous version, Python 2.5, added the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement
as an optional feature, to be enabled by a ‘from __future__ import
with_statement’ directive.  In 2.6 the statement no longer needs to be
specially enabled; this means that *note with: 1c0. is now always a
keyword.  The rest of this section is a copy of the corresponding
section from the "What’s New in Python 2.5" document; if you’re familiar
with the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement from Python 2.5, you can skip this
section.

  The ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement clarifies code that previously would
use ‘try...finally’ blocks to ensure that clean-up code is executed.  In
this section, I’ll discuss the statement as it will commonly be used.
In the next section, I’ll examine the implementation details and show
how to write objects for use with this statement.

  The ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement is a control-flow structure whose
basic structure is:

     with expression [as variable]:
         with-block

  The expression is evaluated, and it should result in an object that
supports the context management protocol (that is, has *note
__enter__(): 1ff. and *note __exit__(): 200. methods).

  The object’s *note __enter__(): 1ff. is called before _with-block_ is
executed and therefore can run set-up code.  It also may return a value
that is bound to the name _variable_, if given.  (Note carefully that
_variable_ is _not_ assigned the result of _expression_.)

  After execution of the _with-block_ is finished, the object’s *note
__exit__(): 200. method is called, even if the block raised an
exception, and can therefore run clean-up code.

  Some standard Python objects now support the context management
protocol and can be used with the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement.  File
objects are one example:

     with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             print line
             ... more processing code ...

  After this statement has executed, the file object in _f_ will have
been automatically closed, even if the *note for: 2f0. loop raised an
exception part- way through the block.

     Note: In this case, _f_ is the same object created by *note open():
     2d6, because ‘file.__enter__()’ returns _self_.

  The *note threading: 179. module’s locks and condition variables also
support the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement:

     lock = threading.Lock()
     with lock:
         # Critical section of code
         ...

  The lock is acquired before the block is executed and always released
once the block is complete.

  The ‘localcontext()’ function in the *note decimal: 80. module makes
it easy to save and restore the current decimal context, which
encapsulates the desired precision and rounding characteristics for
computations:

     from decimal import Decimal, Context, localcontext

     # Displays with default precision of 28 digits
     v = Decimal('578')
     print v.sqrt()

     with localcontext(Context(prec=16)):
         # All code in this block uses a precision of 16 digits.
         # The original context is restored on exiting the block.
         print v.sqrt()

1.2.3.1 Writing Context Managers
................................

Under the hood, the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement is fairly complicated.
Most people will only use ’*note with: 1c0.’ in company with existing
objects and don’t need to know these details, so you can skip the rest
of this section if you like.  Authors of new objects will need to
understand the details of the underlying implementation and should keep
reading.

  A high-level explanation of the context management protocol is:

   * The expression is evaluated and should result in an object called a
     "context manager".  The context manager must have *note
     __enter__(): 1ff. and *note __exit__(): 200. methods.

   * The context manager’s *note __enter__(): 1ff. method is called.
     The value returned is assigned to _VAR_. If no ‘as VAR’ clause is
     present, the value is simply discarded.

   * The code in _BLOCK_ is executed.

   * If _BLOCK_ raises an exception, the context manager’s *note
     __exit__(): 200. method is called with three arguments, the
     exception details (‘type, value, traceback’, the same values
     returned by *note sys.exc_info(): 2f3, which can also be ‘None’ if
     no exception occurred).  The method’s return value controls whether
     an exception is re-raised: any false value re-raises the exception,
     and ‘True’ will result in suppressing it.  You’ll only rarely want
     to suppress the exception, because if you do the author of the code
     containing the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement will never realize
     anything went wrong.

   * If _BLOCK_ didn’t raise an exception, the *note __exit__(): 200.
     method is still called, but _type_, _value_, and _traceback_ are
     all ‘None’.

  Let’s think through an example.  I won’t present detailed code but
will only sketch the methods necessary for a database that supports
transactions.

  (For people unfamiliar with database terminology: a set of changes to
the database are grouped into a transaction.  Transactions can be either
committed, meaning that all the changes are written into the database,
or rolled back, meaning that the changes are all discarded and the
database is unchanged.  See any database textbook for more information.)

  Let’s assume there’s an object representing a database connection.
Our goal will be to let the user write code like this:

     db_connection = DatabaseConnection()
     with db_connection as cursor:
         cursor.execute('insert into ...')
         cursor.execute('delete from ...')
         # ... more operations ...

  The transaction should be committed if the code in the block runs
flawlessly or rolled back if there’s an exception.  Here’s the basic
interface for ‘DatabaseConnection’ that I’ll assume:

     class DatabaseConnection:
         # Database interface
         def cursor(self):
             "Returns a cursor object and starts a new transaction"
         def commit(self):
             "Commits current transaction"
         def rollback(self):
             "Rolls back current transaction"

  The *note __enter__(): 1ff. method is pretty easy, having only to
start a new transaction.  For this application the resulting cursor
object would be a useful result, so the method will return it.  The user
can then add ‘as cursor’ to their ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement to bind
the cursor to a variable name.

     class DatabaseConnection:
         ...
         def __enter__(self):
             # Code to start a new transaction
             cursor = self.cursor()
             return cursor

  The *note __exit__(): 200. method is the most complicated because it’s
where most of the work has to be done.  The method has to check if an
exception occurred.  If there was no exception, the transaction is
committed.  The transaction is rolled back if there was an exception.

  In the code below, execution will just fall off the end of the
function, returning the default value of ‘None’.  ‘None’ is false, so
the exception will be re-raised automatically.  If you wished, you could
be more explicit and add a *note return: 2f4. statement at the marked
location.

     class DatabaseConnection:
         ...
         def __exit__(self, type, value, tb):
             if tb is None:
                 # No exception, so commit
                 self.commit()
             else:
                 # Exception occurred, so rollback.
                 self.rollback()
                 # return False

1.2.3.2 The contextlib module
.............................

The *note contextlib: 6e. module provides some functions and a decorator
that are useful when writing objects for use with the ’*note with: 1c0.’
statement.

  The decorator is called ‘contextmanager()’, and lets you write a
single generator function instead of defining a new class.  The
generator should yield exactly one value.  The code up to the *note
yield: 2f7. will be executed as the *note __enter__(): 1ff. method, and
the value yielded will be the method’s return value that will get bound
to the variable in the ’*note with: 1c0.’ statement’s *note as: 2f8.
clause, if any.  The code after the *note yield: 2f7. will be executed
in the *note __exit__(): 200. method.  Any exception raised in the block
will be raised by the *note yield: 2f7. statement.

  Using this decorator, our database example from the previous section
could be written as:

     from contextlib import contextmanager

     @contextmanager
     def db_transaction(connection):
         cursor = connection.cursor()
         try:
             yield cursor
         except:
             connection.rollback()
             raise
         else:
             connection.commit()

     db = DatabaseConnection()
     with db_transaction(db) as cursor:
         ...

  The *note contextlib: 6e. module also has a ‘nested(mgr1, mgr2, ...)’
function that combines a number of context managers so you don’t need to
write nested ’*note with: 1c0.’ statements.  In this example, the single
’*note with: 1c0.’ statement both starts a database transaction and
acquires a thread lock:

     lock = threading.Lock()
     with nested (db_transaction(db), lock) as (cursor, locked):
         ...

  Finally, the ‘closing()’ function returns its argument so that it can
be bound to a variable, and calls the argument’s ‘.close()’ method at
the end of the block.

     import urllib, sys
     from contextlib import closing

     with closing(urllib.urlopen('http://www.yahoo.com')) as f:
         for line in f:
             sys.stdout.write(line)

1.2.4 PEP 366: Explicit Relative Imports From a Main Module
-----------------------------------------------------------

Python’s *note -m: 2fb. switch allows running a module as a script.
When you ran a module that was located inside a package, relative
imports didn’t work correctly.

  The fix for Python 2.6 adds a ‘__package__’ attribute to modules.
When this attribute is present, relative imports will be relative to the
value of this attribute instead of the ‘__name__’ attribute.

  PEP 302-style importers can then set ‘__package__’ as necessary.  The
*note runpy: 14b. module that implements the *note -m: 2fb. switch now
does this, so relative imports will now work correctly in scripts
running from inside a package.
