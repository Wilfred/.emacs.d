;;; Commentary:

;; You will need to configure Emacs to find racer:
;;
;; (setq racer-rust-src-path "<path-to-rust-srcdir>/src/")
;; (setq racer-cmd "<path-to-racer>/target/release/racer")
;;
;; To set up racer for completion in Rust buffers, add it
;; `rust-mode-hook':
;;
;; (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook #'racer-activate)
;;
;; To use TAB for both indent and completion in Rust:
;;
;; (require 'rust-mode)
;; (define-key rust-mode-map (kbd "TAB") #'racer-complete-or-indent)
;;
;; You can also use racer to find definitions. To bind this to a key:
;;
;; (require 'rust-mode)
;; (define-key rust-mode-map (kbd "M-.") #'racer-find-definition)
