FMT is a string which may contain format characters that are
expanded. See `realgud-expand-format' for a list of the format
characters and their meanings.

in commands that continue execution.

If FRAME-SWITCH? is set, the fringe overlay array icon is set to
indicate the depth of the frame.

debugger prompt.
