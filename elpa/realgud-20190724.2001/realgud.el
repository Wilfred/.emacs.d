;;; Commentary:

;; A modular, extensible GNU Emacs front-end for interacting with
;; external debuggers.
;;
;; Quick start: https://github.com/realgud/realgud/
;;
;; See URL `https://github.com/realgud/realgud/wiki/Features' for features, and
;; URL `https://github.com/realgud/realgud/wiki/Debuggers-Supported' for
;; debuggers we can handle.
;;
;; Once upon a time in an Emacs far far away and a programming-style
;; deservedly banished, there was a monolithic Cathederal-like
;; debugger front-end called gud.  This interfaced with a number of
;; debuggers, many now dead.[1]  Is there anyone still alive that
;; remembers sdb from UNIX/32V circa 1980?
;;
;; This isn't that.  Here we make use of more modern programming
;; practices, more numerous and smaller files, unit tests, and better
;; use of Emacs primitives, e.g. buffer marks, buffer-local variables,
;; structures, rings, hash tables.  Although there is still much to be
;; desired, this code is more scalable and suitable as a common base for
;; an Emacs front-end to modern debuggers.
;;
;; Oh, and because global variables are largely banned, we can support
;; several simultaneous debug sessions.

;; RealGUD supports many external debuggers.  See URL
;; `https://github.com/realgud/realgud/wiki/Debuggers-Supported' for a
;; list.  However, if you don't see your favorite debugger, see URL
;; `https://github.com/realgud/realgud/wiki/How-to-add-a-new-debugger/'
;; for how you can add your own.

;; The debugger is run out of a comint process buffer, or you can use
;; a `realgud-track-mode' inside an existing comint shell, or eshell
;; buffer.

;; To install you will need a couple of other Emacs packages
;; installed.  If you install via melpa (`package-install') or
;; `el-get', these will be pulled in automatically.  See the
;; installation instructions URL
;; `https://github.com/realgud/realgud/wiki/How-to-Install' for all
;; the ways to to install and more details on installation.

;; [1] Four or more years in, as of 2018 realgud sports a number of
;; old debuggers too.  However we *mark* them as such, and move them
;; out of the main code base.  See for example:
;; https://github.com/realgud/realgud-old-debuggers.  So that's
;; another difference: this code better *maintained*.

;;; Code:

;; Press C-x C-e at the end of the next line configure the program in
;; for building via "make" to get set up.
