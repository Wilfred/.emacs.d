;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a generalization of an idea by Mickey Petersen of
;; masteringemacs fame:
;;
;; Use one keystroke to jump from a code buffer to the corresponding repl
;; buffer and back again.
;;
;; This works even if you do other stuff in between, as the last buffer
;; used to jump to a repl is stored in a buffer local variable in the
;; repl buffer.
;;
;; `repl-toggle-mode` will automatically be activated for `prog-mode`
;; major modes and configured and the started repl-buffers.
;;
;; There are no repl/mode combinations preconfigured, put something like
;; the following in your emacs setup for php and elisp repl:
;;
;;     (setq rtog/fullscreen t)
;;     (require 'repl-toggle)
;;     (setq rtog/mode-repl-alist '((php-mode . php-boris) (emacs-lisp-mode . ielm)))
;;
;; This defines a global minor mode, indicated with 'rt' in the modeline, that
;; grabs "C-c C-z" as repl toggling key-binding.
;; I don't know with which repl modes this actually works. If you use
;; this mode, please tell me your ~rtog/mode-repl-alist~, so that I can
;; update the documentation.
;;
;; ** ~pop~ or ~switch~: ~rtog/goto-buffer-fun~
;;
;; Emacs -- of course -- has more than one function to switch between
;; buffers. You can customize ~rtog/goto-buffer-fun~ to accommodate your
;; needs. The default is ~switch-to-buffer~; to move focus to another
;; frame that already shows the other buffer, instead of switching the
;; current frame to it, use ~pop-to-buffer~.
;;
;;     (setq rtog/goto-buffer-fun 'pop-to-buffer)
;;
;; ** Configurations known to work
;;
;; - ~(php-mode . psysh)~
;; - ~(emacs-lisp-mode . ielm)~
;; - ~(elixir-mode . elixir-mode-iex)~
;; - ~(ruby-mode . inf-ruby)~
;; - ~(js2-mode . nodejs-repl)~ and ~(js3-mode . nodejs-repl)~
;;
;; *** Switch to shell buffer
;;
;; If the mode you want to use doesn't jump to an existing repl-buffer,
;; but always starts a new one, you can use `rtog/switch-to-shell-buffer'
;; in your configuration to get that behaviour, e.g. for `octave-mode':
;;
;;     (rtog/add-repl 'octave-mode (rtog/switch-to-shell-buffer 'inferior-octave-buffer 'inferior-octave))
;;
;; ** Pass code at point to the REPL
;;
;; When you supply the universal prefix argument to the switching function,
;;
;; - C-u passes the current line or active region
;; - C-u C-u passes the current defun
;; - C-u C-u C-u passes the whole current buffer
;;
;; to the repl buffer you switch to.
;;
;; ** fullscreen REPL
;; If you set =rtog/fullscreen= to true, the repl-commands will be
;; executed fullscreen, i.e. as single frame, restoring the window-layout
;; on switching back to the originating buffer.
;;
;;     (setq rtog/fullscreen t)~
;;
;; ** Fallback REPL function
;;
;; The custom variable =rtog/fallback-repl= can be customized with a
;; function; this function will be called if no REPL is associated with
;; the current buffers major mode.
