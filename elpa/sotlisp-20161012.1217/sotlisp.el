;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This defines a new global minor-mode `speed-of-thought-mode', which
;; activates locally on any supported buffer.  Currently, only
;; `emacs-lisp-mode' buffers are supported.
;;
;; The mode is quite simple, and is composed of two parts:
;;
;;; Abbrevs
;;
;; A large number of abbrevs which expand function
;; initials to their name.  A few examples:
;;
;; - wcb -> with-current-buffer
;; - i -> insert
;; - r -> require '
;; - a -> and
;;
;; However, these are defined in a way such that they ONLY expand in a
;; place where you would use a function, so hitting SPC after "(r"
;; expands to "(require '", but hitting SPC after "(delete-region r"
;; will NOT expand the `r', because that's obviously not a function.
;; Furtheromre, "#'r" will expand to "#'require" (note how it ommits
;; that extra quote, since it would be useless here).
;;
;;; Commands
;;
;; It also defines 4 commands, which really fit into this "follow the
;; thought-flow" way of writing.  The bindings are as follows, I
;; understand these don't fully adhere to conventions, and I'd
;; appreciate suggestions on better bindings.
;;
;; - M-RET :: Break line, and insert "()" with point in the middle.
;; - C-RET :: Do `forward-up-list', then do M-RET.
;;
;; Hitting RET followed by a `(' was one of the most common key sequences
;; for me while writing elisp, so giving it a quick-to-hit key was a
;; significant improvement.
;;
;; - C-c f :: Find function under point.  If it is not defined, create a
;; definition for it below the current function and leave point inside.
;; - C-c v :: Same, but for variable.
;;
;; With these commands, you just write your code as you think of it.  Once
;; you hit a "stop-point" of sorts in your tought flow, you hit `C-c f/v`
;; on any undefined functions/variables, write their definitions, and hit
;; `C-u C-SPC` to go back to the main function.
;;
;;; Small Example
;;
;; With the above (assuming you use something like paredit or
;; electric-pair-mode), if you write:
;;
;;   ( w t b M-RET i SPC text
;;
;; You get
;;
;;   (with-temp-buffer (insert text))

  - if it contains a `$', this char will not be inserted and
    point will be moved to its position after expansion.
