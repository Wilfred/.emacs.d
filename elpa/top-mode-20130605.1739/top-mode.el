;;; Commentary:

;; This code runs top from within emacs (using top's batch mode), and
;; provides functionality to operate on processes.

;; In order to run it, just execute M-x top.  Unlike real top, the
;; resulting buffer doesn't refresh automatically (yet, it's a feature
;; I'd like to add someday).  You can refresh the buffer manually by
;; pressing 'g'.  If you'd like to mark processes for later actions,
;; use 'm' to mark or 'u' to unmark.  If no processes are marked, the
;; default action will apply to the process at the current line.  At
;; the time of this writing, the valid actions are:
;;
;;     -strace a process
;;     -kill processes
;;     -renice processes

;; You can also toggle showing processes of a specific user by
;; pressing 'U'.
;;
;; NOTE:  tested only on Debian GNU/Linux unstable and solaris 8.
;;
;; Should work out of the box for Debian's version of 'top', however
;; for solaris 8's version of top, I found the following settings to
;; be useful:
