;; This program is tested on GNU Emacs 22, 23.

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; First, save this file as transpose-frame.el and byte-compile in a directory
;; that is listed in load-path.
;;
;; Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'transpose-frame)
;;
;; To swap x-direction and y-direction of windows arrangement, for example,
;; just type as:
;;
;;   M-x transpose-frame
;;
;; Have fun!
