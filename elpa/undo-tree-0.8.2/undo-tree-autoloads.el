Toggle undo-tree mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A positive prefix argument turns the mode on.
A negative prefix argument turns it off.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Undo-Tree mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `undo-tree-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

Undo-tree-mode replaces Emacs' standard undo feature with a more
powerful yet easier to use version, that treats the undo history
as what it is: a tree.

The following keys are available in `undo-tree-mode':

  \\{undo-tree-map}

Within the undo-tree visualizer, the following keys are available:

  \\{undo-tree-visualizer-mode-map}

Non-nil if Global Undo-Tree mode is enabled.
See the `global-undo-tree-mode' command

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')

Toggle Undo-Tree mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global Undo-Tree mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.
Enable the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

Undo-Tree mode is enabled in all buffers where
`turn-on-undo-tree-mode' would do it.
