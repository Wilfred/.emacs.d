;; Provides commands for explicitly unfilling (ie. unwrapping)

;; filling and unfilling the current paragraph or region.

;; Based initially on Xah Lee's examples, and later rewritten based on an article by Artur Malabarba.

This command does the inverse of `fill-paragraph'."

(defun unfill-region (start end)
  "Replace newline chars in region from START to END by single spaces.
This command does the inverse of `fill-region'."
  (interactive "r")

(defun unfill-toggle ()
  "Toggle filling/unfilling of the current region, or current paragraph if no region active."
