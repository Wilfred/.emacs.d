(autoload 'use-package-autoload-keymap "use-package" "\
Loads PACKAGE and then binds the key sequence used to invoke
this function to KEYMAP-SYMBOL.  It then simulates pressing the
same key sequence a again, so that the next key pressed is routed
to the newly loaded keymap.

This function supports use-package's :bind-keymap keyword.  It
works by binding the given key sequence to an invocation of this
function for a particular keymap.  The keymap is expected to be
defined by the package.  In this way, loading the package is
deferred until the prefix key sequence is pressed.

Declare an Emacs package by specifying a group of configuration options.

For full documentation, please see the README file that came with
this file.  Usage:

  (use-package package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:init          Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config        Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that if
               loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not execute
               until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface       Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this can
               be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that should be
               seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode          Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:interpreter   Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands      Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
               package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily loaded,
               and you wish to conditionally call functions in your `:init'
               block that are defined in the package.

:bind          Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*         Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
               *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap   Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
               package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*  Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer         Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
               `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode' or `:interpreter'.
               This can be an integer, to force loading after N seconds of
               idle time, if the package has not already been loaded.

:after         Defer loading of a package until after any of the named
               features are loaded.

:demand        Prevent deferred loading in all cases.

:if EXPR       Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled      The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines       Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions     Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path     Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish      Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:ensure        Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin           Pin the package to an archive.
