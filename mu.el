;;; Commentary:

;; This is is a MUSH or MUD client.  Instead of using telnet or
;; standalone client to connect to your favorite MUSH or MUD, you can
;; use mu.el to play within Emacs.

;; I used to play using tinymud.el, but decided to rewrite it based on
;; comint-mode.  :)

;; Before playing, customize `mu-worlds'.  Then use `mu-open' to open a
;; connection to one of the worlds.  This will automaticall create a mu
;; connection buffer and a mu buffer.  You can type commands in either
;; buffer and send them to the host with RET.  The output will be in the
;; mu connection buffer.

;; If you load ansi-color.el, you should be able to get ANSI colors.

;;; Code:

(require 'comint)
(load "ansi-color" t)

(defgroup mu nil
  "A MUSH or MUD client."
  :group 'processes)

(defcustom mu-worlds nil
  "List of worlds you play in.
You need to define the worlds you play in before you can get
started.  In most worlds, you can start playing using a guest account.

Each element WORLD of the list has the following form:

\[NAME HOST PORT CHARACTER PASSWORD]

NAME identifies the connection, HOST and PORT specify the network
connection, CHARACTER and PASSWORD are used to connect automatically.

Note that this will be saved in your `custom-file' -- including your
passwords!  If you don't want that, specify nil as your password."
  :type '(repeat
	  (vector :tag "World"
		  (string :tag "Name")
		  (string :tag "Host")
		  (integer :tag "Port")
		  (string :tag "Char" :value "guest")
		  (string :tag "Pwd" :value "guest")))
