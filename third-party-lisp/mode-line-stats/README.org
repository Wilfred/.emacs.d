* Installation
  Copy all the =.el= files into a directory in your Emacs =load-path= (such as =.emacs.d/site-lisp/=) and optionally =byte-compile-file= them.

  Add the following into your ~/.emacs startup file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'mode-line-stats)
    (mode-line-stats-mode)
  #+END_SRC

  You can toggle the primary and secondary formats with =C-ยบ=.
