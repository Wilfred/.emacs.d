;;; Commentary

;; Relative line numbers, Vim style.

;; This will modify the linum (line numbering) behaviour in Emacs. To
;; enable it in a single buffer, do `M-x linum-mode` or execute
;; (linum-mode 1).

;; To enable this globally, add this to your .emacs:
;; (global-linum-mode t)

;; Tip: to jump N lines forwards/backwards, use a prefix argument with
;; next-line:

;; E.g. to move 5 lines forward:
;; C-u 5 C-n
