/**
 * An example WrapFactory that can be used to avoid wrapping of Java types
 * that can be converted to ECMA primitive values.
 * So java.lang.String is mapped to ECMA string, all java.lang.Numbers are
 * mapped to ECMA numbers, and java.lang.Booleans are mapped to ECMA booleans
 * instead of being wrapped as objects. Additionally java.lang.Character is
 * converted to ECMA string with length 1.
 * Other types have the default behavior.
 * <p>
 * Note that calling "new java.lang.String('foo')" in JavaScript with this
 * wrap factory enabled will still produce a wrapped Java object since the
 * WrapFactory.wrapNewObject method is not overridden.
 * <p>
 * The PrimitiveWrapFactory is enabled on a Context by calling setWrapFactory
 * on that context.
