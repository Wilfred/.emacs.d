;;; Commentary

;; This file is heavily based on the excellent ack-and-a-half.el.

;;; Usage

;; Add you to your .emacs.d:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ag.el") ;; optional
;; (require 'ag)

;; I like to bind ag-project-at-point to F5:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'ag-project-at-point)

;;; Todo:

;; 1. Add ag-regexp
;; 2. Add highlighting to *Ag* buffer
