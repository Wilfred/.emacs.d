;; Ideas:

;; (defcustom racer-complete-in-comments
;;   nil
;;   "foo"
;;   :type 'boolean
;;   :group 'racer)
;;
;; Could complete group value, simple type values, and keys to
;; defcustom.

;; Completing functions and variables based on context.
;;
;; Auto insert space when completing (foo ) if foo takes multiple
;; args.
;;
;; Completion inside emacs style `backticks'.
;;
;; Even when we can't offer an exact set of options, offer the current
;; package as a prefix.
;;
;; Consider only offering autoloaded/required functions in the current
;; file.
;;
;; Offer sensible completion inside (declare ...) forms and
;; (interactive ...) forms.
