;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To support simple indentation of Haskell scripts.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;; 
;; To bind TAB to the indentation command for all Haskell buffers, add
;; this to .emacs:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-simple-indent)
;;
;; Otherwise, call `turn-on-haskell-simple-indent'.
;;
;;
;; Customisation:
;;
;; None supported.
;;
;;
;; History:
;;
;; If you have any problems or suggestions, after consulting the list
;; below, email gem@cs.york.ac.uk quoting the version of you are
;; using, the version of Emacs you are using, and a small example of
;; the problem or suggestion.
;;
;; Version 1.0:
;;   Brought over from Haskell mode v1.1.
;;
;; Present Limitations/Future Work (contributions are most welcome!):
;;
;; (None so far.)

;;; Code:

;; All functions/variables start with
;; `(turn-(on/off)-)haskell-simple-indent'.
