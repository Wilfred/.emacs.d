;;; print-points --- insert a useful debugging statement.

;;; Commentary.
;; I often find myself writing:
;;
;; print "1. Inside do_it"
;; ... later ...
;; print "2. Inside do_it"
;; ... later ...
;; print "3. Inside do_other_thing"
;;
;; This package is to help insert those debugging lines with one
;; keystroke.
